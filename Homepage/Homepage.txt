NEW DELHI: China's ByteDance is cutting the size of its 2,000-plus India team and is unsure when it will make a comeback, the company told employees in an internal memo on Wednesday, months after its popular TikTok video app was banned. The move came after India this month decided to retain its ban on TikTok and 58 other Chinese apps following responses from the companies on issues such as compliance and privacy. TikTok, WeChat, Baidu and UC Browser among 59 Chinese apps permanently banned in IndiaThe ban dates from last year when political tension between the neighbours rose over their disputed border. "We initially hoped that this situation would be short-lived ... we find that has not been the case," ByteDance wrote in the memo which was seen by Reuters. "We simply cannot responsibly stay fully staffed while our apps remain un-operational ... we don't know when we will make a comeback in India" In a statement, the company said it was disappointing that despite its efforts it had not received a clear direction on how and when its apps could be reinstated. It did not specify how many employees would lose their jobs. Before the ban, India had been one of TikTok's largest markets and ByteDance in 2019 had laid out plans to invest $1 billion in India. At the time of last year's ban, the Indian government described the apps as prejudicial to the "sovereignty and integrity of India". The move followed a skirmish with Chinese troops. In the United States, the previous Trump administration ordered ByteDance to divest TikTok citing national security concerns, and sought to impose restrictions that would have effectively barred its use. TikTok has also come under scrutiny in Australia for any risks it may pose to users from around potential foreign interference and data privacy issues.

New, or old: Which tax regime makes the most sense for you?

NEW DELHI: The Union Budget is around the corner and given the tough year it has been due to the pandemic, the expectations of the salaried taxpayers are high. The year 2020 was challenging for the salaried class. From salary cuts to coping with additional expenses due to remote working and inability to claim certain exemptions like fuel reimbursements, etc, the salaried class braved it all. Given this, the taxpayers are expecting relief in the form of increase in exemptions/deductions from the government in the upcoming Budget. Last yearâs Budget introduced the new concessional tax regime that offers an individual the option to choose lower tax rates in lieu of forgoing certain tax exemptions and deductions. Some of these benefits include standard deduction, exemption towards house rent allowance, leave travel allowance, house property loss, and deduction towards provident fund contributions and life insurance premiums. Budget 2021: Why finance minister should not bring in any new taxThe new regime, effective from financial year 2020-21, prescribes tax rates ranging from 5% to 30% with the highest tax rate applicable for income above Rs 15 lakh. This option is beneficial in those cases where an individual has fewer exemptions and deductions to be claimed. Individuals with higher income levels and tax-saving investments qualifying for deductions or exemptions may not find the new regime attractive. Evaluation of certain factors will be important for individual taxpayers before deciding whether to continue with the old tax regime or opt for the new tax regime.     Individuals with limited deductions or exemptions would have the advantage of more tax savings by opting for the new tax regime. The level of tax savings would depend on the income levels and every individual would have to undertake a fact-specific evaluation keeping in mind her/his investments. While the new tax regime is beneficial for a select segment of individual taxpayers, there is a need to address the expectations of the other set of individual taxpayers who prefer to invest for securing their future and would like to avail the deductions linked to investments.   The pandemic has resulted in a financial burden on many and, hence, the taxpayers are looking for relaxations like extension of benefit to non-senior citizens (under the current law, senior citizens are allowed deduction of up to Rs 50,000) for medical expenditure under Section 80D, increasing the cap of interest on housing loan, extension of additional benefits available for first-time homebuyers, extending the benefit of the newly introduced LTC cash voucher to the next financial year, additional investment opportunities for availing tax benefits through investment in infrastructure bonds etc. Given the varied profile of taxpayers, there exists a case for coexistence of both the regimes going forward. - Amarpal S Chadha(The author is Tax Partner, EY India.

'Don't worry, I will handle it': Navdeep Saini reveals what Rishabh Pant said before hitting the winning runs in Brisbane

NEW DELHI: India needed just three runs to win the Brisbane Test against Australia when tailender Navdeep Saini joined an in form and confident Rishabh Pant in the middle. Saini knew that Pant, who was smashing the Australia bowling attack all over the park with ease, will easily pull it off. And, Pant did the job in his own style, clinching the win with a boundary off pacer Josh Hazlewood to seal a 2-1 series win for India. The next step: How India can become stronger after the high of the Australia series winSaini, in an exclusive interview with Timesofindia.com, revealed the conversation he had with Pant before the wicketkeeper-batsman helped India breach the Gabba fortress and win their second Border-Gavaskar title in a row. Segregated myself but still I was feeling the heat each and every day: Pant"It was the first time that I was batting alongside Rishabh. It was so much fun. I knew he will take India to the win. When I went to the crease, I looked at Rishabh and asked 'kya karna hai'? (What do I have to do?). Rishabh said 'kuch nahi karna, bass tej bhagna, jab bolunga, risky run mat lena (Just run when I say and don't take a risky run). He (Pant) went back to his crease and then came back again and told me 'don't worry, mai dekh lunga' (Don't worry, I will handle it'," Saini told Timesofindia.com. Saini was nursing a groin injury at the time. But thankfully he didn't have to stay out in the middle too long. He didn't face a single delivery and was at the crease for just 3 minutes. "When he (Pant) hit the winning runs, he shouted 'run'. I knew he had asked me to run as fast as possible. I didn't look at where the ball had gone and started running. When he stopped to celebrate, then I realised we had won (laughs). I knew he was going to hammer the bowler," Saini told TimesofIndia.com. Build pressure from both ends: Mohammed Siraj reveals how inexperienced Indian attack planned bowling strategies in AustraliaPant scored an unbeaten knock of 89 runs off 138 balls in the fourth innings of the Gabba Test, including nine fours and one six. For his match-winning show, the youngster was adjudged Man of the Match. Pant also signed off the series as the highest run-getter for India, scoring 274 runs in 3 matches (5 innings) at an average of 68.50. Though he was criticised by some for his wicket-keeping skills earlier , his two knocks (97 in Sydney and 89* in Brisbane) has made even in staunchest critics realise what a game changer he can be with the bat. "He (Pant) is so hard working. He is a mentally strong player. He loves to play in crunch situations. Give him any condition and situation, he is mentally strong. That is his best quality," the Indian pacer who played the Sydney and Brisbane Tests further said. SHASTRI AND RAHANE'S MOTIVATIONAL SPEECHESIndia had already lost all their first-choice picks in the pace department to injury. Ishant Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar didn't travel with the team to Australia. Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, and Jasprit Bumrah were all injured during different stages of the tour. WATCH - Exclusive: Head Coach @RaviShastriOfc delivers a dressing room speech at Gabba.A special series win in Auâ¦ https://t.co/UWM65wPROL— BCCI (@BCCI) 1611070085000Going into the crucial Brisbane Test, India had Saini, Shardul Thakur, both one Test old, Mohammed Siraj and T Natarajan, who was making his Test debut. But Saini was confident of the injury-ravaged Indian team's good show in the crucial Test match and the lanky pace bowler credited his captain Ajinkya Rahane and coach Ravi Shastri's motivational speeches a day before the Brisbane Test for instilling the team with confidence. As we draw curtains on our historic triumph and start our preparations for the home series, hereâs Captainâ¦ https://t.co/CSs5M2m5ib— BCCI (@BCCI) 1611400713000"We were all prepared to take on responsibilities. Ravi sir told us all to prepare, saying 'your turn can come at any time'. He used to watch us closely in the nets. We all used to prepare at the same time and for the same duration and with the same intensity (as the first choice picks). Ravi sir used to take us through different and tough conditions and asked us to practice accordingly. So, we were all prepared. Ravi sir spoke to me ahead of the Brisbane Test and gave me confidence and said 'don't experiment, just bowl the way you have been bowling. Just be mentally strong. You are the best'," Saini revealed. "Ajinkya bhaiya came to me and said 'jaisa domestic mein daalta hai, jaisa nets mein daalta hai waise hi karna.' (Don't experiment or change anything. Bowl the way you've been bowling in domestic cricket and in the nets)," Saini, who took 4 wickets in the two Tests he has played so far said. SHAMI, UMESH AND BUMRAH'S ROLEDuring the net sessions in Australia, Saini learnt a lot from his fast bowling seniors - Shami, Bumrah and Umesh. In fact, Bumrah, who was ruled out of the Brisbane Test after suffering an abdominal strain while fielding in the Sydney Test, was continuously giving tips to Saini and making him feel confident at the Gabba. "The top most thing that helped me on this tour was practice and net sessions. I didn't miss a single net session on this tour. Discussing with seniors Shami bhaiya and Umesh bhaiya helped me a lot. Apart from them, I used to discuss with Jassi (Jasprit Bumrah) also. Shami bhaiya said this kind of situation may come (where Saini might have to play). He is an experienced pacer and has played a good amount of cricket in Australia. So, he is aware of everything. He asked me to put myself in such a situation when no senior is there and the responsibility is on my shoulders - what will I do? He asked me to be prepared for everything," Saini further told TimesofIndia.com. "When I was playing the Brisbane Test, Jassi (Bumrah) used to come during the drinks breaks and give some tips. Ravi sir also supported me a lot. During the match, Shardul, Siraj, Natarajan, and I were discussing the plans and the best part was that we were on the same page. We were backing each other. I have played a decent amount of domestic cricket and that experience also worked for me. I just kept things simple, stuck to my basics, and worked on my strengths," the 28 year old from Karnal said. Saini bowled a total of 251 balls in 4 innings in Australia, giving away 172 runs and taking 4 wickets. His best bowling figures in an innings was 2/54. "I had done a lot of hard work for this tour. When your hard work pays off in the end, it gives you a lot of confidence and happiness. We all gave our 100 percent. We wanted to win the series. That was the ultimate thing. I know injuries happen and that they are part and parcel of this game but all we wanted to win the series. I never had this kind of experience. I will cherish this win forever," Saini, who was recently retained by the Royal Challengers Bangalore ahead of the 2021 season of the IPL further said. PLAYING UNDER RAHANE AND ENGLAND SERIESThis was the first time Saini was playing under Ajinkya Rahane's captaincy. Under Virat Kohli, Saini has played for India in limited-overs (ODIs and T20Is) and at Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL. He feels both Rahane and Kohli are good decision-makers.  "I have played under Virat bhaiya for India and RCB as well. Now I have played under Ajinkya bhaiya. I have enjoyed a lot playing under both the captains. The best part about them is that they are both really good decision-makers. They take decisions on the spot and those work for the team," he said. Saini has been struggling with a groin injury and is not part of the first two Tests against England at home. The series vs England begins on February 5. The first two Tests will be played in Chennai "I am going to NCA right now. I hope that I make it to the rest of the two Tests against England. The Australia series gave me a lot of confidence and helped me mature as a bowler and a player. I want to perform the same way in the upcoming series," Saini signed off.

HYDERABAD: India's first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin effectively neutralises the deadly and infectious UK variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus, reducing the possibility of mutant virus escape, its developer Bharat Biotech said on Wednesday. The research paper 'Neutralisation of UK-variant VUI-202012/01 with Covaxin vaccinated human serumâ, was also uploaded on bioRxiv, a server that carries preprints of research work before it is peer reviewed. âWe performed the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) using sera collected from the 26 recipients of BBV152/COVAXINTM against hCoV-19/India/20203522 (UK-variant) and hCoV27 19/India/2020Q111 (heterologous strain),â the paper said. âA comparable neutralization activity of sera of the vaccinated individuals showed against UK-variant and the heterologous strain with similar efficiency, dispel the uncertainty of possible neutralization escape,â the research paper added. âThe genome of the UK-variant has seventeen mutations, eight of which were found in spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) mediating the attachment of the virus to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the surface of human cells,â the researchers said. âTherefore, it appeared that the majority of the vaccine candidates, being either recombinant or specifically targeting the single epitope of original D614G ancestral spike sequence, might not be able to generate an efficient immune response against the new variants,â it said. âHere, we successfully isolated and characterized the hCoV-19/India/20203522 SARS-CoV-2 (VOC) 202012/01 from UK returnees in India with all signature mutations of the UK-variant,â the paper said. âCOVAXIN developed by @BharatBiotech with @ICMRDELHI has equivalent immunogenicity against the UK-variant & circulating strains of SARS-COV-2 in India. @icmr_niv is the first in the world to culture the UK variant,â tweeted the Indian Council of Medical Research, which has co-developed Covaxin. Covaxin, which is undergoing Phase III efficacy trials on around 26,000 volunteers at 25 sites across the country, has been approved for Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) by the countryâs drug regulator Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) on January 3, 2021. The company recently said that half the volunteers (13,000) participating in the trials have been administered the second dose of Covaxin.

CHANDIGARH: Indian National Lok Dal leader Abhay Singh Chautala on Wednesday tendered his resignation as MLA from the Haryana assembly over the three new farm laws. Speaker Gian Chand Gupta said he has accepted Abhay Chautala's resignation with immediate effect. Abhay Chautala mentioned that he has resigned as farmers' demands have not been met, Gupta told reporters here. The 57-year-old INLD leader was the party's lone MLA in the 90-member State Assembly and represented the Ellenabad seat. Abhay Chautala, who is the younger son of INLD president and former chief minister Om Prakash Chautala, drove to the state assembly complex here in a green tractor to submit his resignation. Earlier this month, the legislator had written to the Haryana assembly speaker, saying if the Centre does not withdraw the three new farm laws by January 26, then his letter may be considered as his resignation as MLA from the House. In the letter to Gupta, Abhay Chautala had slammed the Centre for imposing the "black laws" on farmers in an "undemocratic way" and said the farming community in the entire country is opposing these legislations. After Abhay Chautala's resignation, the Haryana assembly now has 40 MLAs of BJP, 10 of ally JJP, 31 members of main opposition Congress and one MLA of Haryana Lokhit Party. Seven members are Independents, out of whom five including power minister Ranjit Singh Chautala support the ruling combine.

The series begins on February 5 while the second Test will be played from February 13 to 17. The BCCI is also yet to decide whether the IPL will happen in India even though the Board President Sourav Ganguly has repeatedly asserted that everything possible would be done to keep the glitzy event at its home. The 2020 edition was held in the UAE in September-November due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A smooth conduct of India's home series against England from next month should pave the way for the lucrative league to be held at home. The player retention deadline ended on January 20 and the trading window closes on February 4. IPL 2021: Full list of retained and released players of all teamsTop Australian draws like Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell were released from Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab respectively on the last day of the retention deadline. The other notable names to be released were Chris Morris, Harbhajan Singh and Aaron Finch. A total of 139 players were retained by the franchises and 57 players were released. Kings XI Punjab will enter the auction with the biggest purse (Rs 53.20 crore), followed by Royal Challengers Bangalore (Rs 35.90 crore) and Rajasthan Royals (Rs 34.85 crore). With Rs 10.75 crore each, Kolkata Knight Riders and Sunrisers Hyderabad have the lowest purse going into the auction.

For the first time, academic satellites developed by private engineering colleges are being launched by Isro. So far, the agency has launched nine academic satellites that are built by universities in the country. Addressing reporters, chairman of the college S Thangavelu said students and faculty members from four departments -- information technology, computer science, electronics and communication engineering, and electrical & electronics engineering -- had been working on the project for the past ten years and spent over Rs 2 crore to build the satellite. âWe will hand over the satellite to Isro on February 5,â he added. âWe have designed and developed an academic satellite weighing just 460 gram. The satellite would be placed in an orbit at 500 to 575 km above the earth. It would cross India twice a day. To get data round the clock, it will intercommunicate with 300 other satellites. It was built in such a way to collect information regarding thefts in banks, detect underground water leakage and fire accidents in Bengaluru, Chandigarh and ONGC site in Thanjavur. The active period of the satellite is six months, but it would send signals for three years,â he said. He said the satellite would be used only for academic purposes, but information would be made available to students from other colleges and schools to encourage space literacy. âWe have filed for as many as 29 patents so far,â he added. Until recently, most of the satellites that are launched by Isro are government funded. It was only after the formation of Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACE) in June 2020 that privates were being encouraged to develop satellites, he said. The college has set up a satellite ground station on its premises which will be inaugurated by Isro chairman K Sivan on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed the acquittal order of the accused in the case where Nagpur Bench of Bombay High Court had said that groping a minor's breast without "skin to skin contact" can't be termed as sexual assault. The case dates back to February 2020 when a 39-year-old man in Nagpur had been charged for pressing the breasts of a minor. A trial court in Nagpur had sentenced the accused to three yearsâ imprisonment under section 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) and under section 354 IPC (assault or criminal force with intent to outrage a womanâs modesty). Not sex assault if thereâs no skin-to-skin contact: Bombay HCThe man had appealed his conviction following which the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court acquitted the man ruling that âno direct physical contact â skin to skin with sexual intent, without penetration" would not amount to âsexual assaultâ under Pocso Act. Why did the Bombay High Court acquit the man?The HC said the issue before it was whether âpressing of the breastâ and âattempt to remove salwarâ would fall within the definition of âsexual assaultâ as defined under Section 7 and punishable under Section 8 of the Pocso Act. While public prosecutor MJ Khan argued the offence fell within the definition of âsexual assaultâ, the HC held it was ânot possible to acceptââ the prosecutorâs submission. The court said the âbasic principle of criminal jurisprudence is that punishment shall be proportional to the seriousness of the crimeâ. Justice Pushpa Ganediwala of Nagpur bench had said âstricter proof and serious allegations are requiredââ given the stringent punishment of three to five yearsâ imprisonment that âsexual assaultâ under the Pocso Act entails. The HC convicted the man for a âminor offenceâ and sentenced him to one year in jail overruling trial court's three years of punishment. The man was on bail. The HC issued a non-bailable warrant against him and said all his other sentences shall run concurrently and he would be entitled for a set-off of term undergone in custody. Mother found daughter crying inside a bolted roomThe minor had testified that she was lured on a false pretext by the accused to his house. She said he had tried to remove her salwar and had pressed her breast. She tried to shout, but he covered her mouth and left the room after bolting the door from outside. Her mother went to his house while looking for her. She had seen the accused leave, and on reaching the first floor found the door bolted from outside and her daughter crying inside. She then went to the police station along with her daughter to lodge an FIR, noted the HC.

Declare Marathi-speaking Karnataka-Maharashtra border areas as UT: Uddhav

MUMBAI: Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday said areas dominated by Marathi-speaking people on the state's border with Karnataka should be declared as a Union territory till the Supreme Court gives its final verdict on the issue. Speaking at the launch of a book on the boundary dispute between the two states, Thackeray lashed out at the Karnataka government over alleged atrocities on Marathi- speaking population in those areas, and said there is a need to fight to win the case for their inclusion in Maharashtra. Maharashtra claims certain areas, including Belgaum, Karwar and Nippani which are part of Karnataka, contending the majority of population in these areas is Marathi-speaking. The case over the dispute between the two states is pending before the Supreme Court for many years. Thackeray said, "When the case is being heard in the Supreme Court, the Karnataka government renames Belgaum, declares it as its second capital, constructs a Legislature building and holds one legislature session there." "Isn't this contempt of court?" Thackeray asked. He said the "Karnataka-occupied Marathi-speaking areas should be declared as a Union territory" till the Supreme Court gives its final verdict. "We have to learn from past experiences and fight to win. The Karnataka-occupied Marathi-speaking areas will be included in Maharashtra," he asserted. The chief minister also targeted the Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES) for allegedly disintegrating and weakening the Marathi cause for selfish political interests. "Earlier, the MES won half-a-dozen MLAs, Belgaum mayor used to be a Marathi-speaking person. The Shiv Sena never entered the political fray in Belgaum because it did not want to weaken the MES," he said. Thackeray, whose party formed a Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) with the NCP and Congress to form government in 2019, said a time-bound action plan needs to be charted out to win the legal battle and ensure the Marathi- speaking leadership and people in those areas of Karnataka remain united. "Let's take a pledge that we will not rest till we win. If the long pending issue is not resolved during this (MVA) government's tenure, it will never be," he said. "In Karnataka, whichever political party's government or chief minister take charge, they have one thing in common - atrocities against Marathi people and language," he charged. Marathi people should also unite, he said, adding that "let us be determined to win". Speaking on the occasion, NCP president Sharad Pawar said the Mahajan Commission was set up (by the Centre in 1960s) to study and arrive at a conclusion when (Maharashtra leader) Senapati Bapat began his hunger strike. "The then Maharashtra chief minister Vasantrao Naik accepted the commission and agreed that its findings will be binding on the state. But, the commission was 100 per cent against Maharashtra," Pawar said. "We (Maharashtra) rejected the commission's findings. Barrister A R Antulay, the former CM, wrote a book dismissing the Mahajan Commission's report. This book should find a mention in the new book (released on Wednesday)," he said. Pawar said the Supreme Court is the "last weapon for the state" and Maharashtra should use all its legal acumen to win the case. "We have to fight to win. There is no other option. It is good that Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is taking a lead in this direction. Maharashtra needs to sink its political differences and show more unity in this case," he said. The new 530-page book, 'Maharashtra-Karnataka Seemavad: Sangharsh Aani Sankalp' (Maharashtra-Karnataka boundary dispute: struggle and pledge), compiled and edited by Deepak Pawar, an OSD in the state government's boundary dispute cell, gives a detailed account of issue. Deepak Pawar said he has travelled from Bidar to Karwar (in Karnataka) and found that love for Marathi language and culture binds people from the border areas to Maharashtra. "The need of the hour is to assure them that the state of Maharashtra is firmly behind them, and the MES should also be united to carry on the struggle," he said. Maharashtra General Administration Department's principal secretary Shrikant Deshpande said the boundary dispute is a fight for the "Marathi asmita (pride)". The book, comprising articles and cartoons chronicalling the issue over the last 64 years, will help create an awareness about the issue among the new generation and bridge the disconnect between Marathi-speaking locals and other people in Maharashtra, Deshpande said. "Political and social mobilisation is the need of the hour to ensure Marathi language and culture thrive in these areas," he said. Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa recently slammed Thackeray's comments wherein the latter said his government is committed towards incorporating into Maharashtra the areas of Karnataka where Marathi-speaking people are in majority.

BENGALURU: Former AIADMK general secretary VK Sasikala was released from Central Jail, Parappana Agrahara, on Wednesday. However, doctors treating the 66-year-old for Covid-19 at Victoria Hospital have advised against discharging her for the next two-three days. Sasikala was sentenced to four-year imprisonment in 2017 in a disproportionate assets case. Referring to the feedback received from doctors, the official said: âShe is not fit for discharge as of Wednesday. She is being given intermittent oxygen supply and is stable. She will have to stay in the hospital for another three days.â Medical superintendent Dr Ramesh Krishna K said her oxygen saturation level was 98% with two litres of oxygen, blood pressure 126/70 mmHg and blood sugar level 196 mg/dl. She was consuming food orally and was walking with support. A health department official on Tuesday had said: âHer family is yet to decide on getting her discharged. If they insist on moving her out of the hospital on Wednesday, it will be recorded as âdischarged against medical adviceâ. We might do another RT-PCR test as a formality.â

MUMBAI: The steps that were underway, by the Trump administration to rescind the employment authorisation program, for certain categories of spouses of H-1B visa holders, is history. Nearly a lakh Indian spouses can now breathe a sigh of relief. Way back in February 2019, when the Trump administration began to take concrete steps towards rescinding this employment authorisation program, US Vice-President Kamala Harris (who was then a Senator) had tweeted, âThis is outrageous and will force immigrant women who are doctors, nurses, scientists and academics among others to abandon their professional careers. I called on DHS last year to withdraw this proposal and will continue to fight this.â Nearly two years later, this fight comes to an end. This is outrageous & will force immigrant women who are doctors, nurses, scientists & academics, among others, to aâ¦ https://t.co/gBvwDqpTmp— Vice President Kamala Harris (@VP) 1550869727000The proposed rule - âRemoving H-4 dependent spouses from the class of aliens eligible for employment authorisationâ was under review by the Office of Management and Business (OMB). In other words, it was in its final stages of a roll-out. Soon after the Biden administration stepped in, it stayed for a 60-day period, subject to further extensions, various proposed policies including the proposal to rescind the employment authorisation program. Now, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has formally withdrawn this proposed rule. Spouses of H-1B workers are given an H-4 visa. Only in certain cases, such as where the H-1B visa recipient is on track for a green card or where the H-1B visa recipient has got an extension beyond the permitted six years, could the H-4 spouse apply for an employment authorisation document. To take care of the decades-long green card backlog for certain sections, such as applicants from India, the Obama administration in 2015 had introduced the âH-4 Employment Authorization Document (EAD) rule.â Given that the expected wait time for Indians caught in the backlog of the employment-based green card for EB-2 and EB-3 (skilled category) runs to 84 years, according to a CATO Institute study â the EAD program proved to be very useful, especially for families struggling to survive on a single income. According to the latest available official data, up to December, 2017, nearly 84,360 Indian spouses (largely wives) held an EAD (this was 93% of the total EADs issued). The number of such Indian spouses is now estimated to be over a lakh. The EAD program meant more than financial freedom by enabling them to take up jobs or be self-employed, as the work authorisation also enabled spouses to obtain a social security number, open a bank account and get a driving license. SaveH4EAD, a group that started in December 2017, which currently has an outreach of several thousands has tweeted, âAfter years of advocacy, meeting Congress members, DHS/OMB and collecting irrefutable data on value-add of H4-EAD not only to economy but also to provide life of dignity to thousands of immigrants, we are pleased to announce that the new administration has withdrawn regulation to help #SaveH4EAD.â After years of advocacy, meeting congress members, DHS/OMB & collecting irrefutable data on value add of H4EAD notâ¦ https://t.co/dbrmItHazw— Save H4EAD (@SaveH4EADs) 1611703268000TOI has in the past covered the efforts of this group and had narrated how the American dream for many families would be shattered, if the EAD program came to an end. Plans to return or migrate elsewhere emerge for over 80,000 Indian families in USThe H4-EAD program has been involved in a long-drawn lawsuit filed by Save Jobs USA, which states that the EAD program takes away American jobs. Lately delays in getting the EAD extensions in a timely manner, has led to many H-4 visa holders filing lawsuits across the country. The next step according to SaveH4EAD is to streamline the process so that no one loses their jobs owing to processing delays. Todd Schulte, President of FWD.us, a bipartisan political organisation, whose founders include Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and others stated, âWe commend the Biden-Harris Administration for taking immediate action to turn the page from the Trump-Pence Administrationâs disastrous immigration policies, and to do right by more than 100,000 hardworking immigrants who are contributing to the United States every single day in the midst of a deadly pandemic. Allowing H-4 visa holders the ability to continue working and providing for their families has profound, life-changing effects for these individuals and our communities. Roughly 93 percent are women, and many are working in essential roles that are key to supporting our nationâs economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.â âAt the end of the day, there is no successful economic or public health recovery without bold action from lawmakers to protect immigrant essential workers and keep immigrant families safe and together. Congress must work together to immediately pass the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, which would formalize work authorization for H-4 visa holders, create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrant essential workers, and address the bureaucratic backlogs that plague our broken immigration system,â added Schulte.

NEW DELHI: Equity indices fell on Wednesday with the benchmark BSE sensex falling over 900 points, dragged by banking and financial stocks. The 30-share BSE index plunged 938 points or 1.94 per cent to finish at 47,410; while the broader NSE Nifty settled 271 points or 1.91 per cent lower at 13,968. Axis Bank, Titan, IndusInd Bank, HDFC Bank Dr Reddy's, HDFC and Asian Paints were the top losers in the sensex pack falling up to 4.05 per cent. While Tech Mahindra, ITC, PowerGrid and Ultra Cemco were the top gainers rising up to 2.57 per cent. Shares of Reliance Industries slipped as much as 2.29% to an over one-month low of Rs 1,895 after US e-commerce giant Amazon sought to block Future Group's $3.4 billion retail asset sale to the conglomerate, making it the top drag on Nifty. Amazon requested an Indian court to enforce a Singapore arbitrator's order that Reliance's deal with the Future Group be put on hold, Reuters reported on Monday. Amazon moves Delhi HC to enforce Singapore order and block Reliance-Future dealFuture Retail's shares fell 5% on the news, after Amazon.com also called for Future Group's chief executive officer to be detained. "There is some overhang in the markets due to negative global cues and some nervousness ahead of the budget because of which people are lightening their positions" Siddhartha Khemka, head of retail research at Motilal Oswal Securities in Mumbai, told news agency Reuters. Analysts also said that investors have preferred taking profits off the table ahead of the Union Budget and F&O expiry. Adding to the pressure, Asian shares also slipped as investors looked to the Federal Reserve's guidance on monetary policy. Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank slipped 1.58%, after JP Morgan downgraded the stock as the lender reported quarterly results below expectations. Meanwhile, foreign investors sold equities worth Rs 765.30 crore on a net basis in the Indian capital market on Monday, exchange data showed. (With inputs from agencies)

TIRUPATI: Madanapalli police on Tuesday arrested the couple, who killed their two daughters allegedly under the influence of tantriks. The couple was in a state of trance sitting near the bodies of their daughters when the police had reached their home on Sunday. While the father, Dr V Purushotham Naidu, has reportedly come out of the trance, his wife Padmaja continued to behave strangely. Andhra Pradesh couple arrested for killing 2 daughters during occult ritualsShe was singing and dancing and shouting that the novel coronavirus had not originated in China, but created by the gods to cleanse the âbad elementsâ in the Kali Yug. When police took Padmaja to a hospital for Covid-19 test, she refused to give her sample shouting that she herself was novel coronavirus in human form and there was no need for tests. The police have named Naidu as accused No 1 and Padmaja as accused No 2 in the case. The couple on Sunday brutally murdered their daughters, Alekhya (27) and Sai Divya (22), in what appeared to be part of occult practice.

MUMBAI: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday urged the Bombay high court to reject the plea for bail on medical grounds filed by poet-activist Varavara Rao, arrested in the Elgar-Parishad-Maoist links case, arguing that his present health condition is stable. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, who appeared for the NIA, reminded the court that Rao's medical reports from the Nanavati Hospital, from earlier this month, stated that he was stable and fit to be discharged. He pointed out that the Maharashtra government had made a statement before the HC last week, saying once discharged from the private hospital, Rao (81) will not be sent back to the Taloja prison in Navi Mumbai, but instead, he will be admitted to the prison ward of state-run JJ Hospital here and given requisite medical care. "His (Rao's) medical reports, his present health condition is stable, and the state's statement takes care of all the prayers made in these pleas," Singh said. "Therefore, the question of granting him bail arises only if the court doesn't have faith in the care that the JJ Hospital will be able to provide," Singh told a bench of justices SS Shinde and Manish Pitale. The bench was hearing three petitions -- a writ petition seeking Rao's complete medical records and a bail plea on medical grounds filed by Rao. The third one is a writ petition filed by Rao's wife Hemlatha alleging a breach of his fundamental rights owing to lack of medical care during his continued incarceration. Hemlatha, too, had sought in her plea that Rao be let out of prison and be permitted to go back to his family in Hyderabad. The poet-activist, lodged in the Taloja prison as an undertrial, is currently admitted to the Nanavati hospital in Mumbai. Following the NIA's submission, the court, however, pointed out that as per the medical reports, Rao was being given over 20 pills a day. "Just see the list of medicines being given to him everyday. He is sustaining on these medicines. So, he's continuously on medical support," HC said. ASG Singh, however, said most of these pills were "age-related." "We also have old people in our homes and 70 to 80 per cent of these medicines are taken (by elderlies)," the NIA counsel said. He reiterated that as per the Nanavati Hospital report, Rao didn't have dementia, a disease in which there is deterioration in memory, behaviour and the ability to perform everyday activities. The HC, however, pointed out that Rao's reports from the JJ Hospital, the Taloja prison hospital and state-run St George hospital, issued in November last year, all mentioned dementia, and brain atrophy or shrinkage of the brain. Singh, however, said the older report notings on dementia seemed more like "course and discussions" among doctors to check for dementia and delirium. "We have full faith in the JJ Hospital but the Nanavati Hospital, where he was last treated, says he doesn't have dementia right now," Singh said. "We believed the Nanavati Hospital while Rao was being treated there. Why should we not believe it then when he says Rao doesn't have dementia?" he said. Singh said one's health condition could fluctuate often and therefore, while deciding on Rao's medical bail plea, the HC must go by his latest health condition report. "The Nanavati report says Rao doesn't require indoor management and is fit to be discharged. This is the latest report, there is no counter or different medical advice so we have to believe this report," Singh said. "Therefore, unless the court does not have faith or it feels the JJ prison ward will not be able to provide him (Rao) medical care, only then should he be granted bail," Singh said. Rao's counsel, senior advocate Anand Grover argued that the JJ Hospital or any other hospital was a "bed of infection," and the ailing Rao must not be sent there. "The only option is to send him back to the Taloja prison if he is fit, else let him out on bail to be at home with his family," Grover said. The HC then directed the Nanavati hospital to submit a fresh medical report with Rao's latest health condition on Thursday morning and will continue hearing the arguments in the afternoon. Rao has been in an out of the JJ Hospital in Mumbai and the Taloja prison hospital since his arrest in June 2018. On July 16 last year, he tested positive for coronavirus after which he was shifted to the Nanavati Hospital. He was discharged from the Nanavati Hospital following a final assessment report on July 30 and sent back to the Taloja prison. In December last year, he was admitted to the Nanavati Hospital again following the intervention of a bench of Justice Shinde and Justice MS Karnik. The case related to alleged inflammatory speeches made at the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which, the police claimed, triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial located on the outskirts of the western Maharashtra city. The police have claimed the conclave was organised by people with alleged Maoist links. Several activists and academicians have been named as accused in the case.

The HC, however, pointed out that Rao's reports from the JJ Hospital, the Taloja prison hospital and state-run St George hospital, issued in November last year, all mentioned dementia, and brain atrophy or shrinkage of the brain. Singh, however, said the older report notings on dementia seemed more like "course and discussions" among doctors to check for dementia and delirium. "We have full faith in the JJ Hospital but the Nanavati Hospital, where he was last treated, says he doesn't have dementia right now," Singh said. "We believed the Nanavati Hospital while Rao was being treated there. Why should we not believe it then when he says Rao doesn't have dementia?" he said. Singh said one's health condition could fluctuate often and therefore, while deciding on Rao's medical bail plea, the HC must go by his latest health condition report. "The Nanavati report says Rao doesn't require indoor management and is fit to be discharged. This is the latest report, there is no counter or different medical advice so we have to believe this report," Singh said. "Therefore, unless the court does not have faith or it feels the JJ prison ward will not be able to provide him (Rao) medical care, only then should he be granted bail," Singh said. Rao's counsel, senior advocate Anand Grover argued that the JJ Hospital or any other hospital was a "bed of infection," and the ailing Rao must not be sent there. "The only option is to send him back to the Taloja prison if he is fit, else let him out on bail to be at home with his family," Grover said. The HC then directed the Nanavati hospital to submit a fresh medical report with Rao's latest health condition on Thursday morning and will continue hearing the arguments in the afternoon. Rao has been in an out of the JJ Hospital in Mumbai and the Taloja prison hospital since his arrest in June 2018. On July 16 last year, he tested positive for coronavirus after which he was shifted to the Nanavati Hospital. He was discharged from the Nanavati Hospital following a final assessment report on July 30 and sent back to the Taloja prison. In December last year, he was admitted to the Nanavati Hospital again following the intervention of a bench of Justice Shinde and Justice MS Karnik. The case related to alleged inflammatory speeches made at the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which, the police claimed, triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial located on the outskirts of the western Maharashtra city. The police have claimed the conclave was organised by people with alleged Maoist links. Several activists and academicians have been named as accused in the case.

TIRUPATI: The superstitious couple, arrested by police on charges of brutally murdering their daughters, continued to remain in a state of trance according to Madanapalli sub-jail authorities. Madanapalli sub-jail superintendent Ramakrishna Naik told reporters that both Dr V Purushotham Naidu and his wife Padmaja spent a sleepless night on their first day in the prison. Padmaja who was seen meditating the whole night kept on shouting the name of Lord Shiva aloud, which scared fellow prisoners in the all women prisoners area in the sub-jail. Jail authorities told TOI that in view of their mental condition, they were once again taken to the psychiatrist at the Madanapalli government hospital on Wednesday. Based on the doctor's advise they will have to be admitted to the psychiatric ward either at SVIMS or at the SVRR government general hospital in Tirupati. "We will present the recommendations of the government psychiatrist before the local magistrate and based on the outcome of his directions, we will shift them to Tirupati for better medical attention", the jail authorities told reporters on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: With work from home becoming the new normal, it is going to be difficult for the finance minister to separate salary from business income. Raising the standard deduction for salaried employees may help level the field.Two years ago, in July 2019, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented her maiden budget -- and the first Budget of the second term of the NDA government. In that Budget, she hiked the standard deduction for salaried employees to Rs 50,000 from Rs 40,000. Union Budget 2021-22: Complete coverageThe standard deduction is an amount that is deducted from an individualâs salaried taxable income, thus reducing the taxable income. Clearly, if the government wants to put more money in the hands of the taxpayer (as it may need to in order to boost demand that has been choked by Covid-related lockdowns), a substantial increase in the standard deduction makes sense. Except that the finance minister, in the Budget presented in February 2020, had eliminated the standard deduction for taxpayers who opted to enter a new tax regime where lower tax slabs were offered to those who forgo the standard deduction and a host of other exemptions. These tax slabs are 5 to 10 percentage points lower than the older slabs -- at the lower end of the income scale. At the higher end (income of Rs 15 lakh plus), the tax rate remains the same. Tax mavens have discussed the new scheme at length, and see it as the governmentâs first, exploratory move into a no-exemption regime. Is this fair to salaried employees? In an article written in June 2019 by EY, it was made clear that income-tax rules seem skewed against salaried employees. While businesspeople and consultants can claim exemptions against all kinds of expenses every month, salaried employees have far fewer options. Tax is deducted at source by the employer, significantly reducing take-home pay. New, or old: Which tax regime makes the most sense for you?EY also offered a hypothetical case of a salaried employee and a consultant. Both make the same gross income of Rs 30 lakh, one as salary and one as fees. Post tax, however, the story is vastly different. The salaried employee pays Rs 6.73 lakh in taxes. The consultant, meanwhile, pays Rs 2.18 lakh. The salaried employee takes home Rs 4.55 lakh less than the consultant. The finance ministry disagreed with this reading. In a written response, the ministry said: âThe tax paid on taxable salary income and on gross amount of professional receipts cannot be compared as the taxable income in case of professionals is computed after allowing all the expenses incurred for carrying-out the profession. These expenses include rent for office space, salaries & wages of employees, electricity expenses for the office, printing & stationery etc. However, in respect of a salaried individual, there is no requirement to maintain any office and the office expenses are borne by the employer. The only major expenses required to be incurred by a salaried individual for earning salary income is the expense incurred for commuting to the office. For this purpose and other miscellaneous petty expenses which a salaried individual might have to incur, a standard deduction is allowed to the salaried taxpayer which is currently Rs. 50,000.â The purpose of the EY piece was not to question the expenses legitimately allowed to professionals. Rather, it was to highlight the fact that salaried employees had very few options to claim equally legitimate expenses. Now more than ever, people are working from home and are using computers and phones for official work. But they are not allowed to claim even a part of what they spend on buying such equipment as deduction from income. Some countries, such as Denmark and South Korea, allow such deductions to salary earners, and this is something the government could seriously consider now that âwork from homeâ is not just accepted but necessary. Budget 2021: Why finance minister should not bring in any new taxThe few deductions that are allowed to the salaried are unrealistically lower than the actual cost of the services. For instance, the limits for childrenâs education allowance (Rs 100 per month per child, up to two children) and hostel allowance (Rs 300 per month per child, up to two children) were last revised almost two decades ago. The governmentâs claim that standard deduction of Rs 50,000 will take care of incidental expenses rings somewhat hollow. EY said the re-introduced standard deduction subsumed the tax-exempt transport allowance â an annual figure of Rs 19,200 and the medical reimbursement that could be claimed up to Rs 15,000. In short, the end benefit was just an annual incremental net reduction in taxable income of Rs 5,800. Now compare this to what a professional can claim. For starters, thereâs the presumptive tax scheme. Under this, professionals can file their return declaring 50% of their gross returns (subject to gross receipts not exceeding Rs 50 lakh). After the tax-saving investments under Section 80 are accounted for, the professional needs to pay tax only on the balance income. Of course, receipts in excess of Rs 50 lakh will need to be audited and the actual expenses as per the audited accounts are allowed as a deduction. While presumptive tax has really helped smaller and medium-sized professionals, it has resulted in stark disparity between salaried employees and consultants with the same income. The finance ministry disagrees, and says that in the case of presumptive tax, âit is presumed that 50% of his gross receipts are expended towards various expenses required to be incurred for carrying out his profession. However, this is not a standard deduction and it has also been provided in the Act that if the professional incurs expenses less than 50% of the gross receipts, then he has to declare the higher income.â The previous finance minister, the late Arun Jaitley, saw this in a different light. In his 2018-19 budget speech, Jaitley highlighted the fact that an average salary earner pays three times more income tax (Rs 76,306) than a non-salaried taxpayer does (Rs 25,753) â both figures from the budget speech. It will be interesting to see how the finance ministry deals with the issues of presumptive tax and standard deduction in a year when almost the entire country worked out of home. The pandemic-induced lockdown and subsequent restrictions on movement meant that salaried employees and professionals alike spent on office infrastructure at home. This new normal is unlikely to vanish in a hurry. Will the upcoming Budget take this into account when framing the new tax rules? (A version of this article was published in July 2019)

NEW DELHI: The government in the budget next week is expected to announce measures such as extending the facility of bulk clearance for e-commerce imports and exports with a view to promoting the growth of this fast-growing segment in the country, sources said. They said that as there is a multi-fold increase in the e-commerce sector in the country, a significant volume of products is imported into and exported out of India through this platform and there is a need to find a balance between control and facilitation for the sector. Currently, importers and exporters are required to submit individual/separate clearance documents for each package with the Indian customs department, which adds cost for traders to conduct business through e-commerce. "With an aim to support the growth of the e-commerce sector in India, the facility for bulk clearance of import and export is required for e-commerce import and exports. Additionally, a simplified process in case of return of e-commerce shipments would also help in promoting the growth," one of the sources said. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will unveil the Budget for 2021-22 on February 1. According to exporters, easing of processes for the sector would further help in boosting the country's outbound shipments. "Extending the facility of bulk clearance is a good idea. Globally this facility is there. It will help in reducing transaction cost. If it is permitted, it would hugely benefit the e-commerce trade,' Federation of Indian Export Organisations Director General Ajay Sahai said. A leather exporter said that the move if announced in the Budget would help promote exports through e-commerce medium.

NEW DELHI: India is likely to double health spending in the next fiscal year with the aim of raising expenditure in the sector to 4% of gross domestic output in the coming four years, two officials said, as the country looks to fix its health system after the coronavirus pandemic. India will likely raise its health spending to Rs 1.2-1.3 lakh crore ($16.46-$17.83 billion) in the fiscal year starting April 1, from the current year's projected spending of 626 billion rupees, the officials told Reuters. Union Budget 2021-22: Complete coverageThe new healthcare plan is likely to be unveiled on February 1 when finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents the country's budget for 2020/21. The officials did not want to be named as the plan is not yet public. Even after decades of high growth, the country's spending on healthcare has been a meagre 1.3% of GDP, way below BRICS peers and developed countries. The strain of India's underfunded healthcare system was put in stark relief during the pandemic, with states forced to set-up makeshift Covid care centres and many hospitals struggling to meet the demand for beds and oxygen cylinders. India has recorded over 10.6 million coronavirus cases, the second-highest in the world after the United States. Sitharaman is likely to unveil a four year health budget plan with the aim to move India's healthcare spend to 4% of GDP, with the help of a dedicated health fund, the officials said. The government could also increase a health tax from the current 1% of income and corporate tax to fund the new programme, one of the above officials said. Currently it raises about Rs 15,000-16,000 crore annually from the health tax. Finance ministry did not reply to an e-mail seeking comment on the story.

NEW DELHI: The Centre needs to come up with higher budgetary allocation for power distribution infrastructure in the upcoming Union Budget, sector stakeholders and experts said. ICRA has recommended higher budgetary allocation to strengthen the power distribution infrastructure and improve the financial viability of the distribution segment, including the implementation of amendments to the Electricity Act. The government should take measures to augment fund availability and ease land acquisition challenges with a view to achieve the renewable capacity targets, it said. Further, the ratings agency has also suggested support measures to promote investments in the roof-top solar segment. Sector experts have also sought long-term policy measures to promote domestic module manufacturing. Recommendations have also been made to promote investments in transmission infrastructure for harnessing power from renewable projects. Jaideep Mukherji, CEO of Smart Power India, said that as the power sector continues to recover from the pandemic shock, the Union Budget 2021-22 should propose supportive policy measures to address the existing systemic challenges, particularly in the distribution space. "As a major link between the power generation sector and the last-mile consumer, the discoms would require continued government support both in terms of policy action and necessary stimulus packages to build greater financial resilience and operational efficiency in the long run," he said. A healthy distribution sector, in turn, will enhance the quality and reliability of power supply, prompting economic activities, employment generation and social development, especially in rural communities, he said. He was of the view that, as laid out in last year's budget, the focus should also continue to remain on technology adoption such as smart meters to reduce the aggregate technical and commercial losses. "I also believe that corrective measures in processes such as metering, billing, and collection (MBC) will not only improve the overall power demand but will also have a significantly positive impact on discoms revenue generation and profitability," Mukherji said. He also said that budget should take into account the economic contribution of the renewable energy sector and offer necessary support both in terms of relevant policy action and budgetary spend to harness the true potential of the sector.

NEW DELHI: The Budget 2021-22 may see the trade-off to become more acute between stimulating growth, and maintaining fiscal rectitude, Kotak Institutional Equities said in a pre-budget note. The Covid-19 pandemic disruptions has pushed down the country GDP growth into the negative zone in two successive quarters and projections are that GDP may contract over 7 per cent in FY21. This contraction has come on the the back of increased spending by the government on Covid relief measures that has already taken up the country's fiscal deficit several notches with expectations that deficit may run at a high of 7.5 per cent of GDP in FY21 as against budget target of 3.5 per cent. "The government needs to aim at increasing stable incomes for large parts of the population in the middle and bottom of the pyramid which have been the worst hit from the pandemic. "We expect the budget to strengthen the Atmanibhar Bharat vision and focus on health, physical infrastructure, and financial sector along with rural India," said Suvodeep Rakshit, Vice President and Senior Economist at Kotak Institutional Equities. The brokerage also expects budget announcements around DFI for infrastructure financing or 'bad' bank to take centrestage as the government aims to finance long term growth. It, however, does not expect expect the government to announce any major changes in taxes though some changes to custom duty, especially on finished/near-finished items could be increased in line with the PLI scheme for select sectors. According to Rakshit there is a need for the government to maintain an easy fiscal. The brokerage expects fiscal deficit of 5.5 per cent of GDP in FY22. "We expect a slightly lower market borrowing to finance the deficit which will maintain the upward pressure on long term rates. We continue to expect the yield curve to flatten given that the pace of policy normalization would weigh more on the shorter end of the curve," the brokerage said.

NEW DELHI: The government may give a 'Make in India' push to oil and gas explorers, as it is considering a proposal to almost halve cess on domestic crude oil to encourage exploration activity and allow Covid-hit oil producers to protect their margins. The glut in the oil market and deep suppression of demand during the peak of pandemic in 2020 had pushed down crude oil prices to unprecedented levels. Though crude prices have recovered over the vaccination drive against Covid and a pick in demand coupled with unilateral production cut announced by Saudi Arabia, cess puts domestic crude at a disadvantage against imported oil. Cess on domestic crude is currently levied at the rate of 20 per cent of the value of oil. Official sources said the proposal by the Union oil ministry is to reduce it to 10 per cent. If this is accepted by the finance ministry, the changes may be announced as part of Budget 2021-22 proposals, sources said. Though the larger view is in favour of halving the cess, the exact quantum would be worked out later. The reduction in the levy has huge revenue implications as ONGC alone pays cess in excess of Rs 10,000 crore annually. The changes would also provide a level playing field to domestic companies as imported crude does not attract cess. "Cess is levied only on crude oil produced domestically. Thus, it places domestic crude oil production vis-a-vis imported crude oil at a significant disadvantage as imported crude does not attract such duty. This levy is against the spirit of 'Make in India'," industry chamber FICCI had said in a memorandum given to the finance ministry earlier. "Abolition of the OID (Oil Industry Development) cess for pre-NELP and nomination blocks, reduction in rates of royalty and greater marketing freedom are some measures that will help revive investments and fast-track growth in the sector. Greater support to exploration in the form of faster approvals and self-certification will boost investor sentiment and send a strong message to international investors on the ease of doing business in India and attract further capital," said Sunil Duggal, Group CEO & chief safety officer, Vedanta Ltd. The finance ministry had revised oil cess in the FY17 Union Budget, shifting it from a specific charge of Rs 4,500 per tonne of crude to an ad valorem rate of 20 per cent. This was done to help the exploration firms from higher cess burden at a time when crude oil prices were falling. Though oil prices are moving at over $50 a barrel for some time now, fluctuations in pricing always puts domestic crude producers at a disadvantage. The problem is magnified as cess incurred by producers is not recoverable from refineries and forms part of cost of production of crude oil. The Oil Industry (Development) Act, 1974, provides for collection of cess as a duty of excise on indigenous crude oil. This adds to the loss of revenue for exploration companies. The government is looking to reduce the tax burden on oil companies to push up domestic production that has stagnated for past several years at around 30-35 million tonne. The reduction in oil cess would benefit upstream companies such as ONGC and Cairn India whose production is subjected to the oil industry development cess levied on an ad valorem basis. But under the new open acreage licensing policy (OALP), which provides pricing and marketing freedom to operators along with the power to select the block for exploration, does not attract oil cess. This puts the older oil and gas blocks at a disadvantage to any new hydrocarbon finds. Currently, state-owned ONGC and OIL pay a cess on crude oil they produce from their allotted fields on a nomination basis. Cairn Oil and Gas has to pay the same cess for oil from the Rajasthan block. Most of crude oil produced in India comes from pre-NELP and nomination blocks and is liable for payment of cess. NELP blocks like Reliance Industries' KG-D6 are exempt from payment of cess while pre-NELP discovered blocks like Panna/Mukta and Tapti and Ravva pay a fixed rate of cess of Rs 900 per tonne. The cess was levied at Rs 60 per tonne in July 1974 and subsequently revised from time to time. In 2005-06, when the crude oil prices had increased from an average of $40 per barrel to $60, the OID cess was raised from Rs 1,800 to Rs 2,500 per tonne from March 1, 2006. Again, when the crude prices climbed to over $100, the rate of cess went up to Rs 4,500 ($12 per barrel) with effect from March 17, 2012.

Experts said the Budget has been below par considering investors had extremely high expectations from the government to revive the economy. Presenting the Union Budget, Nirmala Sitharaman proposed to remove dividend distribution tax (DDT) on companies, effectively shifting the tax burden to recipients at the applicable rate. She said certain government securities will be open for foreign investors, adding that the Centre plans to increase investment limit for FPIs (foreign portfolio investors) in corporate bonds from 9 per cent to 15 per cent. The government also pegged fiscal deficit at 3.8 per cent in the current fiscal, compared to the earlier target of 3.3 per cent of GDP. It estimated nominal GDP growth for 2020-21 at 10 per cent.

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday introduced new slabs and reduced the tax rate for different slabs for an individual income of up to Rs 15 lakh per annum, if a taxpayer opts for foregoing exemptions and deductions. The new tax regime will be optional and the taxpayers will be given the choice to either remain in the old regime with exemptions and deductions or opt for the new reduced tax rate without those exemptions, she said in the Lok Sabha while unveiling the Budget 2020-21. Under the proposal, people with an annual income of Rs 5 lakh to Rs 7.5 lakh will have to pay a reduced tax rate of 10 per cent; between Rs 7.5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh 15 per cent; between Rs 10 lakh and 12.5 lakh 20 per cent; between Rs 12.5 lakh and 15 lakh 25 per cent; and above Rs 15 lakh 30 per cent, she said. The proposal would lead to a revenue sacrifice of Rs 40,000 crore per annum, she added. The minister further said that the new regime will be optional and the people can continue with old regime if they desire so. Observing that there are about 100 tax exemptions and deductions, she said that 70 of them are being removed in the new simplified tax regime, while the remaining will be reviewed and examined in due course. Citing an example, she said, a person earning Rs 15 lakh per annum would be able to save Rs 78,000 in taxes by opting for the new tax regime. The finance minister also proposed deferment of tax payment by employees on employee stock ownership plan (ESOPs) from startups by five years.

NEW DELHI: The daily Covid-19 recovered cases in India have been surpassing daily new cases from the last 20 days, while the total active cases stand at 1,76,498 comprising just 1.65 per cent of the total infections, the Union health ministry said on Wednesday. The cumulative recoveries have surged to 1,03,59,305 with 13,320 patients being discharged in a span of 24 hours. A total of 12,689 daily new cases were added to the national tally during the same period. "India has one of the lowest daily Covid-19 new cases per Million population (69) in the last 7 days," the ministry highlighted. These sustained encouraging results have been made possible with the Centre-led proactive and calibrated strategy of test, track, treat technology, the ministry underlined. Early identification through high and aggressive testing, prompt surveillance and tracking, supervised home isolation combined with high quality medical care through Standard of Care protocol issued by the Centre have aided the sustained high number of recoveries, it stated. There has been continued focus of the Union and state and UT governments on improved and effective clinical treatment in hospitals, supervised home isolation, use of non-invasive oxygen support, use of steroids, anticoagulants, and improved services of the ambulances for ferrying patients for prompt and timely treatment. The Union government has supported the state and UT governments with sufficient quantity of ventilators, PPE kits, drugs, etc. Tireless efforts of ASHA workers have ensured effective surveillance and tracking progress of the patients in supervised home isolation, the ministry underscored. The 'eSanjeevani' digital platform has enabled telemedicine services which have been successful in containing the spread of Covid while simultaneously enabling provisions for non-Covid essential healthcare. The Centre has also focussed on building the clinical management capacities of the doctors manning the ICUs. The 'National e-ICU on Covid-19 Management'exercise conducted by domain experts from AIIMS, New Delhi has substantially helped in this. As on January 27, more than 20 lakh (20,29,480) beneficiaries have received the shots under the countrywide Covid-19 vaccination exercise. In a span of 24 hours, 5,671people were vaccinated across 194 sessions. A total of 36,572 sessions have been conducted so far, the ministry said. It said that 84.52 per cent of the new recovered cases are observed to be concentrated in 9 states and UTs. Kerala has reported the maximum number of single day recoveries with 5,290 newly recovered cases. A total of 2,106 people recovered in Maharashtra in a span of 24 hours followed by 738 in Karnataka. Over 84 per cent of the new cases are from 7 states and UTs. Kerala continues to report the highest daily new cases at 6,293. It is followed by Maharashtra with 2,405, while Karnataka reported 529 new cases. Seven states and UTs account for 83.94 per cent of the new deaths. Maharashtra saw the maximum casualties (47). Kerala follows with 19 daily deaths and Chhattisgarh with 14. "India has reported only 1 death per million population in the last seven days," the ministry said.

HYDERABAD: India's first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin effectively neutralises the deadly and infectious UK variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus, reducing the possibility of mutant virus escape, its developer Bharat Biotech said on Wednesday. The research paper 'Neutralisation of UK-variant VUI-202012/01 with Covaxin vaccinated human serumâ, was also uploaded on bioRxiv, a server that carries preprints of research work before it is peer reviewed. âWe performed the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT50) using sera collected from the 26 recipients of BBV152/COVAXINTM against hCoV-19/India/20203522 (UK-variant) and hCoV27 19/India/2020Q111 (heterologous strain),â the paper said. âA comparable neutralization activity of sera of the vaccinated individuals showed against UK-variant and the heterologous strain with similar efficiency, dispel the uncertainty of possible neutralization escape,â the research paper added. âThe genome of the UK-variant has seventeen mutations, eight of which were found in spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) mediating the attachment of the virus to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the surface of human cells,â the researchers said. âTherefore, it appeared that the majority of the vaccine candidates, being either recombinant or specifically targeting the single epitope of original D614G ancestral spike sequence, might not be able to generate an efficient immune response against the new variants,â it said. âHere, we successfully isolated and characterized the hCoV-19/India/20203522 SARS-CoV-2 (VOC) 202012/01 from UK returnees in India with all signature mutations of the UK-variant,â the paper said. âCOVAXIN developed by @BharatBiotech with @ICMRDELHI has equivalent immunogenicity against the UK-variant & circulating strains of SARS-COV-2 in India. @icmr_niv is the first in the world to culture the UK variant,â tweeted the Indian Council of Medical Research, which has co-developed Covaxin. Covaxin, which is undergoing Phase III efficacy trials on around 26,000 volunteers at 25 sites across the country, has been approved for Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) by the countryâs drug regulator Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) on January 3, 2021. The company recently said that half the volunteers (13,000) participating in the trials have been administered the second dose of Covaxin.

Pfizer wants India to order Covid-19 vaccine before pursuing approval

NEW DELHI: Pfizer Inc will pursue its request for India to approve its Covid-19 vaccine if the government commits to buying shots, the US drugmaker told Reuters on Monday, even as global supplies tighten. Pfizer was the first company to seek emergency-use authorisation (EUA) for a Covid-19 vaccine in India, but the government this month approved two much cheaper shots - one from Oxford University/AstraZeneca and another developed at home by Bharat Biotech with the Indian Council of Medical Research. Indiaâs Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) says Pfizer officials failed to turn up to meetings after the companyâs application was made in early December. The regulator has also declined to accept the companyâs request for approval without a small local trial on the vaccineâs safety and immunogenicity for Indians, Reuters has reported. Pfizer says its application is supported by data from a global study that shows an overall efficacy rate of 95% with no vaccine-related, serious safety concerns. It also says that, based on the same data, the vaccine developed with German partner BioNTech has been approved in Britain, the United States, the European Union and Canada. âThe data collected has been endorsed by various regulatory agencies (including the most evolved) and they have given EUA [based on] ... that data,â the firm said in an emailed response to questions, including on Indiaâs demand for a local trial. âGiven our exclusive priority to government supply, we look forward to a confirmation from the government on necessary supplies, [on the] basis [of] which we will take the regulatory process forward, as we have done across the world,â it added. Last week, government officials in some EU countries said Pfizer had slashed in half deliveries to them, causing frustration and hampering vaccination drives. Indian officials have had discussions with both Pfizer and its U.S. rival Moderna Inc about making their shots in India, given its large pharmaceutical capacity. However, India, the worldâs biggest vaccine maker, says it is mainly relying on shots already approved or tested at home to run its massive immunisation campaign that began on Jan. 16. Pfizer said its current focus was on distributing the vaccine around the world using manufacturing capacity in the United States and Europe. âOnce the pandemic supply phase is over and we enter a phase of regular supplies, Pfizer will evaluate all additional opportunities available,â it said. Asked why it did not attend meetings called by the CDSCO, Pfizer said its officials had not been given enough notice. âThe company representatives have been unable to participate in previous meetings due to extremely short notices of a few hours or less and time-zone limitations,â the company said. âWe remain committed to engaging with the Government of India to make this vaccine available for use by the government in the country.â

NEW DELHI: Indiaâs economy showed signs a recovery is taking root as waning virus cases and a vaccine roll-out supported sentiment and as focus turns to further stimulus possible in the upcoming Union Budget 2021-22. The needle on a dial measuring overall economic activity was unchanged at 5 last month, indicating the economy was coasting along in the fast lane. Although seven of the eight high-frequency indicators tracked by Bloomberg News held steady and one deteriorated, the gauge uses the three-month weighted average to smooth out volatility in the single-month readings. With new infections dipping sharply over the last few months and a nationwide vaccine roll-out put in place this month, consumer confidence and demand look set to grow further. The recovery might get a boost from fresh stimulus in the upcoming budget, which Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present Feb. 1, one of the most high-profile and highly anticipated events on the governmentâs calendar. Business activityActivity in Indiaâs dominant services sector expanded for a third straight month in December, although at a slower pace. The Markit India Services Purchasing Managersâ Index came in at 52.3 in December from 53.7 a month earlier, with a reading above 50 indicating expansion. Hiring activity, however, suffered due to liquidity concerns and labor shortages, among other issues. Coronavirus outbreak: Live updatesManufacturing activity continued to strengthen in December, with businesses stepping up production amid efforts to rebuild inventories. The seasonally adjusted manufacturing Purchasing Managersâ Index was at 56.4, a tick higher than Novemberâs 56.3. Input price pressures were witnessed broadly across both sectors, a factor that is likely to prevent headline inflation from easing sharply in the coming months. ExportsExports regained some ground last month backed by healthy performance of sectors such as iron ore, electronic goods, drugs and pharmaceuticals. âWhile intermittent hiccups may persist, we are hopeful that the performance of exports will strengthen in the coming months, as the Covid-19 vaccine roll-out gathers speed in the major trading partners,â said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA Ltd, in New Delhi. With activity in the economy normalizing, imports also picked up last month and the trade gap expanded. Consumer activityPassenger vehicle sales, a key indicator of demand, rose nearly 14% in December from a year ago, with two-wheeler sales witnessing robust growth. The Reserve Bank of India said in its latest monthly bulletin that the employment situation would brighten in the coming months and that could give a boost to consumer confidence, setting the economy up for a V-shaped recovery. Demand for loans picked up from lows seen in October. Central bank data showed credit grew at more than 6% as of end-December from a year earlier -- higher than the 5.1% growth seen in the second half of October. Liquidity conditions were tighter amid advance tax outflows last month. Industrial activityIndustrial production shrank 1.9% in November from a year earlier. Production of capital goods declined 7.1%, although infrastructure and construction goods showed a slight expansion of 0.7% from a year ago. Output at infrastructure industries contracted 2.6% in November from a year ago. The sector, which makes up 40% of the industrial production index, had contracted by a record 37.9% in April. Both data are published with a one-month lag.

Hospitals and health centres across several cities and towns in many states and UTs could not achieve their Covid-19 vaccination targets on Tuesday thanks to continuing hesitancy among health workers in taking the shot, with a section of doctors in hospitals in Hyderabad even writing letters to their superiors, saying they would rather wait for more options before they take a jab. Reports of several cases of adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) were among the factors which caused health workers to skip the inoculations despite their names listed at the centres. âThereâre cases of adverse effects being reported for the available vaccines and one is still under trial,â read a letter by a senior resident at Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (TIMS) in Hyderabad, referring to Covaxin. âI prefer to wait until there is a better vaccine available,â the doctor said in the letter. As many as 67 health workers at TIMS refused to take the jab on Tuesday. âIf I take the vaccine now, I will not be able to take another vaccine in the near future, which might have better efficacy,â wrote a senior doctor from Osmania General Hospital, where less than 200 out of the 600 beneficiaries listed took the vaccine Scores of health workers skipped inoculation in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad in Maharashtra because of hesitancy. The deputy director for health services, Sanjay Deshmukh, said the refusals were due to anxiety over safety and efficacy of the vaccines. In Nagpurâs Government Medical College and Hospital, the exclusive centre for Covaxin in the city, only 29 out of 100 beneficiaries took the jab on Tuesday.

AHMEDABAD: The shop of Mohammedmiya Masaniya in Ahmedabadâs Dariapur area does not have a shutter or door and remains open 24x7 and throughout the year. Thatâs not the only peculiar thing about the shop. For four generations, the Masaniyas have been selling items needed for post-death rituals of all faiths. The shop, which is called 'Saaj Khaapan ni Dukanâ sells every item required for rituals after the death of a person â irrespective of which religion he belongs to. âMuslims and Christians generally come and ask for `kafanâ (a cloth draped over the dead body) and coffin, but there are between 20 and 30 items that are required when last rites of Hindus are performed. We keep everything that is required,â said Saqib Masaniya, who along with his brother Rizwan, has been manning the shop at Delhi Chakla. Whether there is curfew or more recently during the lockdown, the shop of the Masaniyas has never shut down. âOur shop has no shutter. It remains open round the clock and throughout the year. That is because death can happen anytime in peoplesâ families,â explained Rizwan. Saqib added that during the lockdown, the police themselves escorted them to Motera area, got shops opened and facilitated them to purchase things required for the last rites. âYears ago, when curfew used to be clamped in our area because of riots, our shop remained open round the clock,â said Saqib. Commenting on the pandemic, Saqib Masaniya said that when the Covid-19 pandemic was at its peak, the order for `nanamiâ (the bamboo framework on which a dead body is kept before cremation) grew significantly. Crematoriums of Naroda and Dudheshwar asked for many more `nanamiâ that they usually ask for,â Saqib Masaniya said. Asked how did they know that the increased demand for `nanamiâ was because of Covid-19 deaths, the brothers said that the entire set of about 20 items are sought by families if the death is because of other reasons. âIn case of Covid-19 deaths, other rituals were not possible, as the bodies were sealed in polythene bags,â Rizwan said. The shop has been operational for more than 130 years. âOld timers tell us that it was started by great grandfather Akrambhai. His son Usmanbhai then manned the shop, after which our father Mohammedmiya manned the shop. We are the fourth generation to run the shop now,â said Saqib.

SABONG (WEST MIDNAPORE): Moloy Das, the owner of a steel fabrication unit and a resident of Dandurda village in Sabong, has donated a 0.4-acre plot worth Rs 1 crore, to set up a fire station in Bonai â an adjacent village â to meet a long-standing demand of the locals. Earlier, Rajya Sabha MP Manas Bhuniya and MLA Gita Rani Bhuniya had proposed to build the fire station for the rural belt. After hearing about the proposal, Das felt a sense of duty to donate his land for the betterment of the region. âIn September 2, the land was handed over to the district administration. And on Wednesday, CM Mamata Banerjee laid the foundation stone for the fire station from the administrative meeting in Purulia,â said Gita Rani Bhuniya. âAt 63, I have managed to earn a decent living through running a business. Among my three daughters, the youngest one is studying in a college. After the Bhuniyas proposed to set up a fire station, I discussed the need of the villagers with my family members. We all agreed that setting up a fire station would allow us to thwart major incidents, save property and lives. Hence, we decided to donate the plot. Thereafter, I contacted the local administration, expressing our desire to give up the land,â said Das. He added, âI was inspired by my grandfather, who had made similar donations. He had gifted plots on which a high school and post office were built. Earlier, I had donated another plot for setting up a primary school to cater to the children of my village.â Das plans to donate another plot and contribute towards building a hospital that will serve the villagers and meet the health crisis. âI have no political affiliation. However, I have always believed in serving my countrymen in every little way,â he said. The fire station will serve six blocks. The state government has allotted Rs 3.5 crore to build the fire station. Manas Bhuniya said: âI am elated that Das has voluntarily offered his plot. The fire station will help a large number of villagers.â

VISAKHAPATNAM: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) is in the process of procuring two âBandicootâ branded robotic manhole cleaning machines with about Rs 80 lakh. Having two interconnected structures, the control panel stays outside the manhole. The other structure with an arm and four legs enters the manhole and clears the silt and blockages. The control panel, having infrared cameras, helps in live internal inspection. The person operating the scavenging machine can monitor, control and operate it to perfection. GVMC superintending engineer (water supply & underground drainage management) K Venu Gopal said that the robotic machines would do away the need of sanitary workers entering the manholes for scavenging. âIt can be remotely controlled using simple user interface and the high resolution camera in the control panel works even during night time. It can clean manholes up to 10 metres depth. The sensors attached to this spider-like robot would even detect noxious gases such as methane, hydrogen sulphide, carbon monoxide and others trapped in the manholes, and alert the staff beforehand,â said Venu Gopal. The superintending engineer added that GVMC recently introduced three vehicle-mounted jetting machines to mechanise the sewer and septic tank cleaning operations with about Rs 1.25 crore. âThese include 6,000-litre capacity vehicles and one 1,000-litre capacity vehicle. The smaller one would be deployed in the narrow lanes of the city. These jetting machines would help the GVMC in keeping the underground drainage network free of clogging, silt or blockages. The high pressure water jets from these machines can clear a chocking point, to a maximum extent, located four manholes away in the same UGD line,â said Venu Gopal. There are about 38,000 manholes in the city limits, while the UGD network is spread in about 780 kilometres. The GVMC is also participating in Safaimitra Suraksha Challenge, being conducted by the ministry of housing and urban affairs. As part of the challenge, the focus would also be on mechanised cleaning and capacity building of the workforce. A total prize money of Rs 52 crore will be given to the winning cities.

AHMEDABAD: Muskaan Sheikh is all smiles as she made it to the Top 25 in the country who cleared the Company Secretaries (CS) Foundation Programme Examination held in December. While her All India Ranking (AIR) is 24, she ranked fifth in Ahmedabad Chapter with 77.50%. The results were declared on Monday. A student of SLU College where she is pursuing her second year in BCom studies, Muskaan says she has leaped closer to pursuing her dreams of joining a large corporate and helping her family come out of their financial troubles. Her father is a rickshaw driver whose work has been affected, like many others, in the Covid-19 induced lockdown. She lives in an one-room house in Behrampura in Satya Jivan Leprosy Colony, a special housing colony built for people suffering from leprosy. Her fatherâs yearly income is less than Rs 1 lakh. Sheikhâs grandparents, who passed away some time ago, were victims of the deadly disease. Her sister Sameem Sheikh, who studies with her in the same class, also cleared the foundation exam. Muskaan says the lockdown was not easy for her family. However, some help in the form of food grains and other essential items by a social worker helped her and other members of her society wade through the tough times. She and her sister attended classes for clearing the CS foundation course exam where they were given 50% cut in fees keeping in view their interest in studies and their financial condition. âI want to complete my studies soon and get a job in the corporate sector so that I can offer financial assistance to my family,â Muskaan said. In all, 72 students have successfully cleared the exams from Ahmedabad chapter. Of these, seven have secured a place in the Top 25 AIR. Kunika Shah shared the first position with Rusha Nimavat and Karma Shah in Ahmedabad Chapter. Their AIR ranking is 10 with 84.50%. Sanskruti Thakkar with 83.50% stood second in Ahmedabad while her AIR was 12. The Ahmedabad chapter of the Institute of Companies Secretaries of India provided coaching to students at nominal fees and special concession was also given to underprivileged students, it said in a media statement.

BEIJING: China has begun using anal swabs to test those it considers at high risk of contracting Covid-19, state TV reported, with social media users and travellers squirming over the invasive procedure which doctors say can be more effective in detecting the virus. Officials took anal swabs from residents of neighbourhoods with confirmed Covid-19 cases in Beijing last week, broadcaster CCTV said, while those in designated quarantine facilities have also undergone the test.  Small, localized outbreaks in recent weeks have seen multiple cities in northern China sealed off from the rest of the country and prompted mass testing campaigns -- which up until now have mostly been conducted using throat and nose swabs.  But the anal swabs method "can increase the detection rate of infected people" as traces of the virus linger longer in the anus than in the respiratory tract, Li Tongzeng, a senior doctor from Beijing's You'an Hospital, told CCTV.  Users of China's popular Twitter-like Weibo social media platform reacted to the method with a mix of mirth and horror.  "So lucky I returned to China earlier," one user wrote.  "Low harm, but extreme humiliation," another said, using a laughing emoticon.  Others who had undergone the procedure chimed in with dark humour.  "I've done two anal swabs, every time I did one I had to do a throat swab afterwards -- I was so scared the nurse would forget to use a new swab," one Weibo user joked.  CCTV said on Sunday anal swabs would not be used as widely as other methods, as the technique was "not convenient."  As cases rise around the world, China has imposed stricter requirements on international arrivals in an effort to keep domestic transmission close to zero.  All arrivals into the country must have multiple negative test results and quarantine for at least 14 days in a designated hotel on arrival, with many cities and regions imposing additional home observation requirements.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Cabinet has decided to table a bill in Parliament to amend the Constitution for holding the Senate elections through open vote. The decision was taken during the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, presided over by Prime Minister Imran Khan. âThe government wants the (Senate) polls to be held in a transparent manner and without horse-trading. This is why we want Senate polls to be held through an open ballot,â Information Minister Shibli Faraz told the media after the meeting. He said that in the past, money was used in Senate elections and votes were bought making the House election a mockery. He asked what was the use of an upper house in which people come through purchasing of votes. Faraz also said that people opposing the proposed move are forgetting that their own party had demanded open ballot in the past. âThe government will present a constitutional amendment bill in the parliament so that Senate polls are held through open ballot,â he said. Already the government petitioned to the Supreme Court, seeking direction to hold the upcoming Senate elections through open ballot. The decision is pending. Meanwhile, Dawn newspaper quoted a Cabinet member as saying that Prime Minister Khan tasked his advisor parliamentary affairs Babar Awan to table a bill in the National Assembly for holding Senate elections through open ballot when the adviser was giving a briefing on the status of the government's reference in the Supreme Court. Awan said the government had already laid two bills â Constitution Amendment Bill and Electoral Reforms Bill â in Parliament on the basis of which desired legislation could be done for an open ballot. The Cabinet member said Awan had called a meeting of his ministry and its legislation branch to devise a roadmap on how to proceed with the matter in Parliament. It has been proposed that since Senate polls could not be held through show of hand because every voter has to show his preference in the ballot paper. Therefore, to ensure open identity of the voter, the voter should be required to mention his name on the back side of the ballot paper, according to Dawn newspaper. Senate elections will be held in the first half of next month and prime minister Khan's ruling Pakistan Tehreek-I-Insaf is wary that its own members may vote a gay party policy, according to Opposition parties that are against the move.

TOKYO: Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga apologised on Wednesday after lawmakers from his ruling coalition visited night clubs despite his government's call for people to avoid unnecessary outings to curb the spread of Covid-19. The news is another headache for Suga whose approval rating has tumbled due to dissatisfaction with his handling of the pandemic, which critics have called too slow and inconsistent. "I'm terribly sorry that this happened when we are asking people not to eat out after 8pm and to avoid non-essential, non-urgent outings," Suga told parliament. "Each lawmaker should behave to gain the public's understanding." Japan this month issued a state of emergency in Tokyo and other areas to tame a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases. The measure includes a request for restaurants and bars to close by 8pm although there are currently no penalties for non-compliance. "My behaviour was careless at a time when we are asking people to be patient," Jun Matsumoto, a senior lawmaker from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, told reporters. Matsumoto was speaking following a Daily Shincho magazine report that he had visited two night clubs in Tokyo's posh Ginza district after dining at an Italian restaurant last Monday. Kiyohiko Toyama, a lawmaker from the coalition's junior partner Komeito, also apologised after tabloid Shukan Bunshun reported he had visited a high-end night club in Ginza until late last Friday. Twitter users voiced their frustration. "It is just a matter of time before public anger explodes. I don't want a blanket cash-payout of 100,000 yen ($965), I want them to quit! " wrote one user. "They are really stupid. Don't they think about what they are doing and how the public sees them? If they don't, they are unqualified to represent the public," said another.

NEW YORK: A US bankruptcy judge has approved a $17 million payout to dozens of women who accused jailed movie producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual abuse. Weinstein, 68, was sentenced to 23 years in prison last year after being convicted of rape and sexual assault. Delaware Judge Mary Walrath on Monday agreed to the Weinstein Company's liquidation plan, which sets aside the payment. She overruled the objections of several of Weinstein's victims who complained that the settlement prevented them from pursuing other legal claims. The money will be split between 37 women, meaning they are each likely to receive six-figure sums. Lawyers representing some victims had earlier denounced the proposed settlement as insufficient. Eight accusers who rejected the settlement will be able to sue the ex-Hollywood mogul later. Weinstein was found guilty in February 2020 of a criminal sexual act in the first degree and rape in the third degree in a landmark verdict for the #MeToo movement. His sentence capped a remarkable downfall for the "Pulp Fiction" producer who was accused of years of vile predatory behavior by almost 90 women, including Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek. The Weinstein Company declared bankruptcy in March 2018 after the avalanche of claims. Lantern Capital, later renamed Spyglass Media Group, bought its assets for $289 million. Weinstein is also awaiting trial in Los Angeles on rape and sexual assault charges involving five women.

Ottawa residents seek to dump Trump street name

OTTAWA: Residents of an Ottawa neighborhood are looking to distance themselves from Donald Trump by renaming their street, which bears his name -- once a source of intrigue, but now an embarrassment. Trump Avenue on the Canadian capital's west side is lined with brick homes, each with two-car garages and kids playing hockey in driveways. The Central Park neighborhood, known for New York City-themed street names, was built in the late 1990s -- long before a certain Big Apple real estate mogul entered politics. There's also a Madison Park, Bloomingdale Street, Manhattan Crescent, and Staten Way in the area. Bonnie Bowering moved here in 2008. "When I used to tell people I live on Trump Avenue and I would add, 'Yes, it is The Donald,' people would smirk, some offered sympathies, that sort of thing," she told AFP. "But now -- after he's undermined democracy, and incited an insurrection, a violent attack on the US Capitol -- it's time to change our street name," she said. "Trump doesn't deserve the honor and I think it's inappropriate to have a street named after him in Canada's capital." Ottawa city councilor Riley Brockington started gathering support for the name change from people who live on the street this week. Some residents had been petitioning the city for years to change it, but Brockington resisted, saying he feared offending Trump while he was in office. "I was concerned that there might be ramifications against Canada, that Trump would take punitive measures if word got out that Canada's national capital wanted to take his name off a street sign," Brockington said. "With his exit from the White House, I felt now was a good time to try it." At least 50 percent of residents must agree to the name change to trigger a process that would take several months. That's not soon enough for Diane Hosker, who was out walking her dog Tuesday afternoon. "It was a novelty at first, a fun way to start off a conversation when you told people where you lived," she said. "Now it's an embarrassment." "The man's an idiot and I don't like his brand of politics," she added. Nearby, a father stuck his head out of his front door to call his son in from the cold, and nodded in agreement. Changing the street's name would require new signage, but also new maps and postal addresses for 62 homes. And then there's the matter of selecting a new name. Most other New York names are already taken in Ottawa, and numbered street names such as Fifth Avenue won't do. "We already have one of those in Ottawa," Bowering explained. "I hope we end up with a name that everybody is happy with," she concluded. "Of course, some people say 'Anything would be better.'"

LONDON: As the United Kingdom on Tuesday crossed the grim milestone of 100,000 deaths due to Covid-19, Prime Minister Boris Johnson extended condolences to the kin of victims and said it was hard to "compute the sorrow contained in the grim statistic". Johnson during a Covid-19 briefing on Tuesday said that he and his government take "full responsibility" for the decisions taken by him and his Cabinet to curb the spread of the virus and reduce the fatalities due to the pathogen. The British Prime Minister further said that he "was sorry for every life that has been lost" stating that the government did everything they could possibly do. "I am sorry to have to tell you that today the number of deaths recorded from Covid in the UK has surpassed 100,000, and it is hard to compute the sorrow contained in that grim statistic. The years of life lost, the family gatherings not attended and, for so many relatives, the missed chance even to say goodbye," Johnson said during a briefing on Tuesday. He added, "I offer my deepest condolences to everyone who has lost a loved one; fathers and mothers; brothers and sisters; sons and daughters and the many grandparents who have been taken... I am deeply sorry for every life that has been lost and of course, as Prime Minister, I take full responsibility for everything the government has done. What I can tell you is that we truly did everything we could and continue to do everything we can do." The British Prime Minister pledged that when the country "comes through" this crisis, the British public would come together and remember "everyone we lost". "To all those who grieve, we make this pledge: that when we have come through this crisis, we will come together as a nation to remember everyone we lost, and to honour the selfless heroism of all those on the front line who gave their lives to save others," he said. "We will remember the courage of countless working people -- not just our amazing NHS and care workers, but shop workers, transport staff, pharmacists, teachers, police, armed forces emergency services and many others - who kept our country going during our biggest crisis since the Second World War," he added. According to Sputnik, the UK vaccination campaign started on December 8 and as of Tuesday, around 6.5 million people have received at least one vaccine dose. The vaccination is currently open to five priority groups, including people over 80 years old, some people over 70, clinically vulnerable persons, personnel of care homes, and medical workers. There are currently three authorised vaccines in the United Kingdom -- the domestically-made AstraZeneca, the US-German Pfizer/BioNTech, and the one developed by US company Moderna. Johnson called for lessons to be learnt and reflect on once "those vaccines have finally freed us" and added that the best "and most important thing" the people can all do to honour the memory of those who have died from Covid-19 is to "work together with ever greater resolve to defeat this disease." As per the latest update by Johns Hopkins University, the United Kingdom has over 3.7 million Covid-19 cases and 100,359 deaths from the deadly virus across the country.

From sunny Florida, Trump casts shadow over Republican Party

WASHINGTON: He's gone, he's golfing, but from his palm lined Florida hideaway Donald Trump is also plotting revenge. If many Americans -- perhaps discreetly including a number of senior Republicans -- wished Trump would just disappear at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, they're in for a sore disappointment. As an impeachment trial clanks into gear in Washington, the disgraced ex-president is making clear to Republican senators that they need to remember he is a major force. An announcement on Monday that he was opening "the Office of the Former President" in his new hometown reminded them. "President Trump will always and forever be a champion for the American People," the statement said. Senators are considering Trump's fate in the first impeachment trial ever of a former president and -- after last year's version -- the first time a president has been twice impeached at all. But Trump -- winner of 74 million votes in his defeat to Biden on November 3 and reportedly sitting on some $70 million in campaign funds -- wants Republican senators to consider their own futures before they dare cross him. At least 17 Republicans would need to join the 50 Senate Democrats for a conviction in his trial. Every day that goes by, this appears less likely. On Tuesday, a Republican senator's motion to declare the trial unconstitutional got support from all but five Republicans, the strongest indication yet that a bipartisan conviction is dead on arrival. Yes, a lot of Republican lawmakers are furious at Trump's incitement of a crowd to march on Congress on January 6 in a bid to interrupt certification of President Joe Biden's election win. But Republicans also want to win back the House of Representatives and Senate in the 2022 midterm elections and the White House in 2024. And for now at least, being pro-Trump is arguably the best way to achieve this. According to a January Washington Post-ABC News poll, nearly six in 10 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents believe the party needs to remain under Trump's leadership. Trump's main way of applying pressure while out of office is to threaten disloyal legislators with support for their challengers in party primary votes ahead of the 2022 midterms. Trump's endorsement on Monday of his former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders in her bid to become governor of Arkansas was a first flexing of political muscle. Sanders is competing with more senior party officials in the state for the shot at high office. But in the race to be the most loyal Trump acolyte, she already wins hands down and can expect to reap the rewards. For those who have failed the Trump purity test, nervous days await. During the four years of his presidency, Trump ground down almost any internal opposition. So he was stung by the outpouring of criticism over his actions on January 6 and he'd like revenge. Those on the list include the 10 Republicans in the House who voted with Democrats for his impeachment and now are likely to face primary challenges. If senators go further by voting for his conviction, that would trigger an even harsher response from Trump and grassroot Republicans who believe his lie that he was robbed of election victory. Responding to reports that Trump was considering founding a breakaway right-wing party, advisor Jason Miller told Axios that the ex-president is fully supportive of the Republican Party -- for now. "It's completely up to Republican senators if this is something that becomes more serious," he was quoted as saying. One Republican feeling the tension is Marco Rubio, a senator in Florida. He is loyally attacking the impeachment trial as a "waste of time" and "vengeance from the radical left." But is this enough? Rubio did not support Trump's last-minute attempts to challenge congressional certification of Biden's victory, putting him in the potential crosshairs. Speculation is rife that Rubio's seat could be challenged in the 2022 primary by none other than Ivanka Trump, the ex-president's ambitious daughter and former White House advisor. Asked about this scenario by Fox News on Sunday, Rubio looked uncomfortable.

Coronavirus: 100 million Covid-19 cases worldwide

WASHINGTON: More than 100 million Covid-19 cases have now been recorded worldwide, according to an AFP tally on Tuesday, as newly-inaugurated President Joe Biden pledged to ramp up the United States's struggling vaccine program. The number of cases, compiled from data provided by national health agencies, represents just a fraction of the real infections as the coronavirus has spread around the globe.   The United States, which passed 25 million confirmed cases last weekend, remains the country with the largest outbreak -- and the largest death toll of over 420,000. Biden is seeking to turn around the fight against the virus, which took a ferocious grip on the country during Donald Trump's presidency when the risks were downplayed and officials gave mixed messages on mask-wearing other safety measures. Biden said vaccinating the entire US population was a daunting challenge, and the program inherited from the Trump administration "was in worse shape than we anticipated or expected." "This is a war-time undertaking. It's not hyperbole," he said, announcing the US was buying an additional 200 million doses and will have enough to vaccinate 300 million Americans -- virtually the entire population -- by early fall. In another day of grim milestones, Britain surged past 100,000 Covid-19 deaths, and other European nations looked to tighten their borders, hoping to keep out new, more transmissible virus strains. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was "hard to compute" the loss felt by British families after his country became the first European country to surpass 100,000 Covid-19 deaths. But he said his government, which faced criticism over its initial response to the outbreak, "did everything that we could to minimize suffering and minimize loss of life." According to the London Times, the UK government will announce Wednesday that British travellers must quarantine in hotels near airports for 10 days after returning from 30 high-risk countries, mostly in South America and Southern Africa. Neighboring Ireland said Tuesday it would enact mandatory travel quarantines for the first time, as well extending its third national lockdown until March 5. Among other European nations looking to strengthen border controls was Germany, which said it is considering almost completely halting flights into the country. "The danger from the numerous virus mutations forces us to consider drastic measures," Interior Minister Horst Seehofer told the Bild newspaper. Iceland meanwhile started to issue vaccination certificates to ease travel for those who have had both required doses. The new measures came as anger rises over grinding anti-coronavirus restrictions, with the Netherlands rocked by nightly riots since it imposed a curfew on Saturday. More than 400 people were arrested after the worst unrest to hit the country in four decades, but the Dutch government said it would not back down. "You don't capitulate to people who smash shop windows," Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra said, calling the rioters "scum." Israeli police also clashed with protesters, arresting 14 people after ultra-Orthodox Jews demonstrated against lockdown measures. With the global death toll at 2.1 million, the world has looked to vaccines to break the gloom, but bickering over access to doses has intensified. Tensions have in particular mounted between the European Union and pharmaceutical firms over delays to deliveries. "Europe invested billions to help develop the world's first Covid-19 vaccines," EU chief Ursula von der Leyen told the virtual World Economic Forum (WEF). "And now, the companies must deliver. They must honor their obligations." Europe's vaccination campaign stumbled after British-Swedish drugs company AstraZeneca warned it would not be able to meet promised targets on EU shipments -- a week after US group Pfizer said it was also delaying delivery volumes. AstraZeneca's CEO insisted Tuesday that the company was not selling vaccines ordered by the EU to other countries at a profit. The widening gap for vaccine supplies between rich and poor countries led both South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to lash out at "vaccine nationalism." Ramaphosa told the WEF that low- and middle-income countries were being shouldered aside by wealthier nations able to acquire "up to four times what their population needs." The row over access to vaccines at the WEF -- normally held at the Swiss ski resort of Davos -- comes as the pandemic compounds economic inequality. Despite Lebanon being under one of the world's strictest lockdowns, father-of-six Omar Qarhani told AFP he was still selling vegetables on the side of a road in Tripoli because he is desperate to support his family. "I'm not scared of corona -- what scares me is being in need and poverty," he said. The IMF now predicts a "cumulative output loss" of $22 trillion -- the equivalent of the entire US economy -- over 2020-25. Nevertheless, optimism that vaccines will bring the pandemic under control and allow economic activity to resume, coupled with stimulus in major economies, boosted the IMF's growth forecast this year to 5.5 percent.

LONDON: The UK on Tuesday hit another grim Covid-19 milestone as the country's death toll from the deadly virus crossed 100,000 since the peak of the pandemic last year, with another 1,631 daily deaths. The total number of fatalities in the country has reached 100,162. "It's hard to compute the sorrow contained in that grim statistic, the years of life lost, the family gatherings not attended and for many relatives not even the chance to say goodbye," said UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, as he unveiled the latest figures at a briefing from 10 Downing Street in London. âIt's an appalling and tragic loss of life. All we can do now is work together with the tolls that we have with the stay at home principle, plus the vaccines, to defeat the virus," he said. Johnson promised that the country will commemorate the lives lost together at a future date and also the "immense national effort" to tackle the pandemic â from health workers to scientists developing vaccines and key workers. England's Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, joined Johnson at the briefing on the "very sad dayâ and went through health data to note that the number of people testing positive for Covid-19 in the UK peaked at an extremely high number but it is coming down. "We need to be realistic that that number will come down relatively slowly over the next two weeksâ¦ We need to be careful we do not relax (lockdown restrictions) too early,â he said. The government's latest data now coincides with earlier Office for National Statistics (ONS) assessment of death certificate data, which had revealed that there have been nearly 104,000 deaths since last year. The UK government's daily death toll figures rely on positive coronavirus tests in the past 28 days and are therefore slightly behind on the death certificate figures. The ONS figures showed that a total of 7,245 registered deaths in England and Wales mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate in the week ending January 15, which is up from 6,057 deaths the week before and is the highest weekly number since April 24, 2020. "It is a tragedy that we have now seen more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19. This is a dreadful milestone to have reached, and behind each death will be a story of sorrow and grief,â said Chris Hopson, Chief Executive of NHS Providers, a membership organisation for the state-funded National Health Service (NHS). "We won't know the true impact of Covid-19 for a long time to come because of its long-term effects â but, as well as the high death rate, it's particularly concerning that this virus has widened health inequalities and affected Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities disproportionately,â he said, urging continued âvigilanceâ among all communities and strictly following the rules of social distancing. âThe vaccine offers hope for the future. This is a key phase in the fight to end Covid-19 but we must stay the course until the end is truly in sight,â he added. The latest figures come as the UK government is considering further measures in its fight against a high rate of infections, including the possibility of imposing compulsory 10-day hospital quarantine for travellers entering Britain from regions believed to be at a high risk of spreading new variants of coronavirus. âThe NHS is still under intense pressure across all parts of the country with 37,899 people in UK hospitals with Covid-19 â and that includes 4,076 on ventilators,â said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock, as he reiterated the message for people to continue following lockdown restrictions. The minister highlighted that his department-led vaccination programme remains on track to meet the government-set target of covering all those under the top priority groups by mid-February, despite vaccine supply pressures. âThe rate limiting factor to this vaccination programme remains supply. As we know, supply is tight. We've had a very strong performance in this past week. And I'm confident that the NHS will deliver every shot that's made available to it,â he said, adding that 78.7 per cent of all over 80s have now been vaccinated as of Monday. The government has also rolled out a new Community Champions scheme through local councils, with popular celebrities including British Indian actors Meera Syal and Sanjeev Bhaskar also launching independent efforts, to help combat reluctance among minority communities towards being vaccinated. âIt is vital that everyone has access to accurate and up to date information about Covid-19. False information about Covid-19 vaccines could cost lives,â said Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick. Over 23 million pounds funding has been allocated to 60 councils and voluntary groups across England to expand work to support those most at risk from Covid-19 and boost vaccine take up. âWe want all communities to take up the offer of a free vaccine and I have been working closely with faith and community leaders to ensure those who may be at higher risk of harm from this virus know how they can benefit from a vaccine,â said Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi. âThe expansion of the Community Champions scheme will help everyone get the advice and information they need about Covid-19 vaccines,â he said.

WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden had his first call with Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, the White House and Kremlin said. US officials said Biden raised concerns about the arrest of opposition figure Alexei Navalny while pressing the Russian president on his nation's involvement in a massive cyberespionage campaign and bounties on American troops in Afghanistan. On a positive note, the two presidents agreed to have their teams work urgently to complete an extension of New START, the last remaining US-Russian arms control treaty, before it expires next month. "In the nearest days, the parties will complete the necessary procedures that will ensure further functioning'' of the pact, the Kremlin said in its readout of the call. Biden has looked to establish a break from the warm rhetoric often displayed toward Putin by his predecessor, Donald Trump. But the new president also is looking to preserve room for diplomacy. Unlike his immediate predecessors, Biden has not held out hope for a "reset'' in relations with Russia but has instead indicated he wants to manage differences with the former Cold War foe without necessarily resolving them or improving ties. And, with a heavy domestic agenda and looming decisions needed on Iran and China, a direct confrontation with Russia is not something he seeks. Moscow reached out last week to request the call, according to the US officials, who were familiar with the call but not authorized to discuss it publicly. Biden agreed but wanted first to prepare with his staff and speak with European allies, including the leaders of Britain, France and Germany. On Tuesday before his call with Putin, Biden spoke to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, pledging the United States' commitment to the decades-old alliance founded as a bulwark against Russian aggression. Biden told Putin that his administration was assessing the SolarWinds breach and the reports that Russia offered the Taliban bounties to kill American troops in Afghanistan,. Biden said the United States is willing to defend itself and will take action, which could include further sanctions, to ensure that Moscow does not act with impunity, according to the administration officials. The Kremlin's readout did not address the most contentious issues between the countries, though it said the leaders also discussed other "acute issues on the bilateral and international agenda.'' It described the talk as "frank and businesslike'' - often a diplomatic way of referring to tense discussions. It also said Putin congratulated Biden on becoming president and "noted that normalization of ties between Russia and the United States would serve the interests of both countries." Among the issues it said were discussed were the coronavirus pandemic, the Iran nuclear agreement, Ukraine and issues related to trade and the economy. The call came as Putin considers the aftermath of pro-Navalny protests that took place in more than 100 Russian cities over the weekend. Biden's team has already reacted strongly to the crackdown on the protests, in which more than 3,700 people were arrested across Russia, including more than 1,400 in Moscow. More protests are planned for the coming weekend. Navalny, an anti-corruption campaigner and Putin's best-known critic, was arrested Jan. 17 as he returned to Russia from Germany, where he had spent nearly five months recovering from nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Biden has previously condemned the use of chemical weapons. Russian authorities deny the accusations. Trump seemed to seek Putin's approval, frequently casting doubt on Russian interference in the 2016 elections, including when he stood next to Putin at their 2018 summit in Helsinki. He also downplayed Russia's involvement in the hack of federal government agencies last year and the allegations that Russia offered the Taliban bounties. Despite this conciliatory approach, Trump's administration toed a tough line against Moscow, imposing sanctions on the country, Russian companies and business leaders for issues ranging from Ukraine to energy supplies and attacks on dissidents. Biden, in his call with Putin, broke sharply with Trump by declaring that he knew that Russia attempted to interfere with both the 2016 and 2020 elections. Biden on Monday told reporters he hoped the US and Russia could cooperate in areas where both see benefit. "I find that we can both operate in the mutual self-interest of our countries as a New START agreement and make it clear to Russia that we are very concerned about their behavior, whether it's Navalny, whether it's SolarWinds or reports of bounties on heads of Americans in Afghanistan,'' Biden said. Biden's approach has met with approval from some former US diplomats who have dealt with Russia and are looking forward to seeing how Biden's team, including national security adviser Jake Sullivan and his nominee to be the No. 3 at the State Department, Victoria Nuland, delineates the contours of Russia policy. Nuland, who held the Europe portfolio at the State Department in President Barack Obama's second term, is reviled by Putin and his aides in particular for her support of pro-Western politicians in Ukraine. She and Sullivan are said to share opinions about how to deal with Moscow, taking a tough line on human rights and Russia's intentions in eastern and central Europe while keeping an open channel to the Kremlin on other matters. But their starting position is complicated, they say, particularly given Putin's experience in dealing with Trump, who frequently undercut his own administration's hawkish stance on Russia by privately trying to cozy up to the Russian leader. Trump also was frequently ill-prepared for foreign leader calls, ignoring warnings from staff, limiting those who could listen on the calls and, especially after calls with Putin, telling very few aides what was discussed. "It's hard but it's doable,'' said Daniel Fried, a US ambassador to Poland and assistant secretary of state for European affairs in the George W. Bush administration. "They're going to have to figure this out on the fly, but it's important to pursue New START without hesitation and push back on the Navalny arrest and other issues without guilt.'' "They need to do both and not let Putin tell them he won't accept New START unless they drop Navalny, SolarWinds or Afghanistan,'' said Fried, who is now with the Atlantic Council. "You have to push back and you can't let Putin set the terms.''

Rome: Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte resigned Tuesday in the hope of forming a new government after weeks of turmoil in his ruling coalition, leaving Italy rudderless as it battles the deadly coronavirus pandemic.  He tendered his resignation to President Sergio Mattarella, the ultimate arbiter of Italian political crises, who invited him to stay on in a caretaker capacity pending discussions on what happens next.  The uneasy coalition that has led Italy since September 2019 was fatally weakened earlier this month by the withdrawal of former premier Matteo Renzi's small but crucial Italia Viva party.  Ahead of a key vote in parliament this week that he looked set to lose, Conte informed his cabinet on Tuesday that he would quit in what supporters said was a move to form a new government.  After the meeting with Mattarella, a spokesman for the president said he "reserves the right to decide (what to do next) and invited the government to stay in office in a caretaker capacity".  Mattarella will open discussions with party leaders on Wednesday afternoon which are likely to lead into Thursday -- leaving a vacuum at the top of the eurozone's third largest economy at a crucial time.  Italy was the first European country to face the full force of the Covid-19 pandemic and has since suffered badly, with the economy plunged into recession and deaths still rising by around 400 a day.  Parts of the country remain under partial lockdown, the vaccination programme has slowed and a deadline is looming to agree plans to spend billions of euros in European Union recovery funds.  Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, one of the leaders of the populist Five Star Movement (M5S), the largest in parliament, earlier said it was time to rally around Conte.  "The country is going through one of its worst ever periods due to the pandemic," he tweeted late Monday. "Now we need unity, we all have to gather around Giuseppe Conte."  - New mandate - Conte's government had been on the verge of collapse since Renzi pulled out on January 13 in a row over the premier's handling of the pandemic.  Renzi in particular warned he risked wasting the EU funds with a 220-billion-euro ($267 billion) spending plan that he said failed to address Italy's long-term structural issues.  The prime minister survived a vote of confidence in parliament last week but failed to secure an overall majority in the upper house, the Senate.  Despite days of talks with senators to seek their support, he looked set to lose a crucial vote on judicial reform in the coming days.  "Conte's calculation is that by moving early, and thereby avoiding a humiliating defeat in the Senate later this week, he would increase his chances of securing a mandate from Mattarella to form a new government," noted Wolfango Piccoli of the Teneo consultancy.  Nicola Zingaretti, leader of the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), the other main partner in the coalition, so far is backing Conte.  He tweeted that he was "with Conte for a new government that is clearly pro-European and supported by a broad parliamentary base".  - Ditch Conte? - But other lawmakers will be needed to form a viable new government -- and "it is currently unclear whether Conte can succeed in such an effort", Piccoli noted.  If he cannot, the M5S and PD could "ditch Conte and look for another candidate" to head a new coalition government.  They are keen to avoid snap elections, which opinion polls suggest would lead to victory for the centre-right coalition comprising billionaire former premier Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia and Matteo Salvini's far-right League party.  Conte, a once obscure law professor, has proved himself remarkably adept at navigating the famously choppy waters of Italian politics.  Since the 2018 elections he has been at the helm of two governments of different political shades.  The first was a fractious and unashamedly populist coalition between M5S and Salvini's League, which ended when the latter pulled out in August 2019.  Conte went on to preside over another unlikely coalition -- the so-called Conte II government -- between M5S and the PD, two former sworn enemies.
