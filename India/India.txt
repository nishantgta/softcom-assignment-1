NEW DELHI: India crossed a crucial milestone in its fight against Covid-19 on Monday with over 20 lakh beneficiaries vaccinated against SARS-CoV2, even as daily new cases of infection as well as deaths were at their lowest in around eight months. On Monday, 9,102 new cases were registered from across the country. Of this, Kerala and Maharashtra accounted for over 57% cases, whereas Kerala alone had 37% of total cases. Similarly, daily deaths on Monday dropped to 117, lowest in more than eight months. While five states - Maharashtra, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Utrar Pradesh and West Bengal - accounted for over 63% of the 117 fatalities, Maharashtra reported the highest 30 deaths, followed by Kerala and Chhattisgarh with 17 and 13 new deaths, respectively. On Monday, 4,08,305 health workers were inoculated in 7,764 sessions across the country. However, only five states â Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana - conducted vaccination sessions on Tuesday because of Republic Day celebrations. Only 5,615 beneficiaries received the jabs on the day, of which Tamil Nadu alone vaccinated 4926 beneficiaries. Officials said declining cases of Covid are reassuring that India is on track and the vaccine hesitancy has also been addressed to a large extent with the massive awareness campaign launched by the health ministry last week. "With a sustained, pro-active and calibrated strategy of the Centre based on âwhole of governmentâ and âwhole of societyâ approach, the daily new cases have seen a consistent decline. This has ensured a steady fall in daily fatalities too, " the ministry said. Active cases per million population in India is also lowest in the world at 128. Germany(3,309), Russia(3,549), Brazil(4,431), Italy (8,138), UK (28,241) and US (29,547) have much higher cases per million population.

NEW DELHI: The script had been read out and the red lines drawn, but nothing went as planned when the farmers took out their tractor rally on Tuesday. A dash to the heart of Delhi on speeding tractors that rammed barricades and even threatened to mow down policemen, widespread vandalism and destruction of public property and prolonged clashes with the cops marred a two-month-long peaceful agitation on the farm laws. This was capped with the unfurling of the Sikh religious flag, Nishan Sahib, at Red Fort even as cops were battling the protesters in the foreground. The leaders who had promised a peaceful march and should have reined in the hotheads did the disappearing act and the volunteers who were supposed to keep the rally on course were not be seen anywhere. This was a pyrrhic victory, bitter harvest of what turned out to be a rudderless agitation when it came to hitting the streets. Police showed extraordinary restraint as use of force against farmers was never on the table during discussions amongst the brass. However, this strategy landed over 120 cops in the hospital, half of them with severe injuries. A few are critical and in ICU. A farmer driving a tractor dangerously crashed into barricades near ITO and died on the spot. Protestors put flags atop a dome after breaching the route during the tractor rally at Red Fort. Ignoring the schedule of 12pm to 5pm that had been agreed upon for the tractor rally, the protesters at Singhu and Ghazipur borders had begun challenging the cops as early as 6.30am. They soon began making attempts to break through the barricades. This was even before the Republic Day parade had begun. By 8am, the barricades at Singhu were down and 45 minutes later, Tikri too had been breached. The tractor rally was on, still on course. By 10am, around 6,000-7,000 tractors had entered Delhi, cocking a snook at police and violating virtually all mutually agreed terms and conditions. When this group reached Mukarba Chowk on G T Karnal Road around 10.40am, it insisted on moving towards Central Delhi, instead of going on the predesignated route. The cops tried to reason with them but the farmers, led by Nihangs on horses carrying swords and kirpans, charged at police and broke several layers of barricades between Mukarba Chowk and Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar. The protesters were teargassed and mild force used but to no avail.  A protester charges a security personnel during clashes at the Red Fort following farmers' tractor parade on Republic Day. (PTI )Meanwhile, a section of farmers at Ghazipur border smashed the barricades at several points and headed towards ITO, through Akshardham and Millennium Park, where they were joined by some farmers from Singhu. Things were getting chaotic at Tikri too. Here, a section of the protesters refused to turn towards Najafgarh and insisted on marching towards Peeragarhi and Central Delhi, leading to day-long clashes with the cops. However, it was at ITO that the protesters met with stiff resistance from the cops which turned the intersection into a battleground. The farmers turned violent and broke barricades, damaged iron railings and dividers and even tried to run over the policemen with their tractors. Around 12.35pm, the cops fired teargas shells and lathicharged the protesters, setting off a cat-and-mouse game. The protesters pelted the cops with stones. A tractor smashes its way past a barricade at Akshardham.With the arrival of reinforcements after the conclusion of the R-Day parade, police succeeded in stopping them from entering the New Delhi district and moving towards Parliament. One section of protesters then turned towards Red Fort with another staying put on Vikas Marg. Having reached the ramparts of Red Fort, the protesters hoisted the Nishan Sahib amidst much cheering even as police were being attacked in the vicinity. It was only late at night that some order could be restored and the crowd removed from the area. The clashes between police and farmers continued throughout the day. Most of the incidents were reported from Mukarba Chowk, Ghazipur, ITO, Seemapuri, Nangloi, Tikri Border and Red Fort. Delhi Police â caught between overseeing R-Day security and handling the spiralling violence â used mild force, including teargas, and suspended internet at many places. The request for the latter was made by the special cell to the home ministry which gave the order without much of an impact. According to intelligence officials, things spun out of control as the protesters were virtually leaderless. While the talks had been held with the elderly union leaders, youngsters took charge on Tuesday morning, refusing to heed any counselling or instructions by police, with the leaders having disappeared from the scene. Reacting to the day's developments, police commissioner S N Shrivastava said, "The time and the routes for the tractor rally were finalised after several rounds of meetings. But the farmers drove their tractors off the routes and before the fixed time, leading to vandalism in which many police personnel were injured." "Public property has also been damaged. I appeal to the protesting farmers not to indulge in violence, maintain peace and return through the designated routes," he added.

NEW DELHI: A 122-member Bangladesh contingent, two IAF women pilots, newly acquired multi-role fighter aircraft Rafales, troops deployed in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and a tableau of newly constituted UT of Ladakh were among the novelties at the 72nd Republic Day parade on Rajpath on Tuesday. However, for the first time in over five decades, the parade had no foreign dignitary as chief guest as British PM Boris Johnson cancelled his visit due to the Covid situation in his country. Also, there was no participation of military veterans and motorcycle-borne daredevils who used to be one of the paradeâs main attractions in past years. Due to Covid restrictions, even the route of the marching contingents was curtailed till National Stadium instead of Red Fort. Even the size of the marching contingents was reduced from regular 144 to 96 so as to keep social distancing among personnel while masks was made mandatory for them. Despite Covid-triggered restrictions, enthusiasm among the spectators was not missing. The armed forces showcased their latest weaponry like T-90 tanks, Brahmos missile system, Pinaka multiple launch rocket system, bridge -laying T-72 tank, integrated communication electronic warfare system and one upgraded Schilka weapon system. Some of these systems are currently deployed in Ladakh to prevent any Chinese incursion. Two Param Vir Chakra and one Ashok Chakra awardees participated in this parade, which was led by parade commander Lt Gen Vijay Kumar Mishra, general officer commanding Delhi Area, and his second-in-command Major General Alok Kacker, chief of staff, Delhi Area. The 122-member Bangladesh military personnel marched in two groupsâ one marching contingent and a military band. The marching contingent comprised personnel from three services and was led by a flight lieutenant, navy lieutenant, one Major and 3 Lt Colonels. This was the third time India hosted a foreign contingent to participate in the parade after the French troops in 2016 and UAE personnel in 2017. Seventeen marching contingents from the armed forces, paramilitary, Delhi Police, NSG, NCC and NSS along with 15 military bands participated in the parade. The Indian Army was represented by a mounted column of 61 Cavalry, seven mechanised columns and six marching contingents. The 172 Madras contingent from the Andamans also participated in the parade for the first time. âFor the first time, any contingent from the (A&N) islands is participating in such a big event on the mainland and therefore boys are very excited. Over 95% personnel are locals who are from different tribes. Our unit, which is part of Madras Regiment, was raised for the sons of the soil and its objective is to create a robust intelligence in the area.â The contingent comprised 96 personnel, 2 JCOs and one officer, said Major Verma. Flight Lieutenant Bhawana Kanth, who became the first woman combat pilot to participate in the parade, took a salute in front of President Ram Nath Kovind when her IAF tableau featuring mock-ups of an LCA, a light combat helicopter and a Sukhoi fighter loaded with made-in-India missiles passed by the VVIP enclosure. The Indian Navyâs tableau showcased models of Indian naval ship (INS) Vikrant and naval operations that were conducted during the 1971 India-Pakistan war. The DRDO showed two tableaux, one showcasing Tejas' successful take-off from aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, and another displaying full complement of the anti-tank guided missile systems. A total of 28 tableaux from different states and departments rolled down Rajpath. Among them was the tableau of Ladakh that made its debut in the parade. It depicted the iconic Thikse Monastery, the regionâs rich cultural heritage and the vision of Ladakh to be carbon-neutral. The UP tableau displayed a model of the upcoming Ram Templeand the tableau of the Department of Biotechnology showcased the indigenous production of Covid vaccines highlighting Indiaâs self-reliance in the fight against the pandemic. While the tableau of ministry of electronics & IT was inspired by the theme 'Digital India, Aatma-Nirbhar Bharat', the labour ministry tableau showed the segments benefiting the most from 'Labour Codes'. The centre of attraction of the 90-minute parade was IAF's display of the countryâs air prowess amid times of the LAC stand-off with China. A vintage Dakota aircraft which had flown troops to âsaveâ Srinagar from attack by tribal militia backed by the Pakistan Army in 1947 and also played a key role in Bangladesh's liberation war, also flew over Rajpath. Another IAF woman pilot Flight Lieutenant Swati Rathore got the honour to be the first woman to be part of this yearâs flypast when she flew a Mi-17 V5 helicopter. A total of 42 aircraft flew in different formations but all eyes were on the Rafale fighter when it performed a âvertical charlieâ at the end of the flypast. Apart from two Rafales, Sukhoi-30s, MiG-29s, Apache and Chinook choppers also drew visitorsâ attention.

NEW DELHI: Former Japanese PM Shinzo Abe and late singer S P Balasubrahmanyam were conferred the Padma Vibhushan on Monday, while former Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, Dalit leader and LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan, Tarun Gogoi and Keshubhai Patel (all three posthumously) and ex-principal secretary to the PM, Nripendra Misra, have been named for the Padma Bhushan. In a list which under the Modi government has shown a tilt towards "Bharat" or the grassroots, as many as 119 Padma awards â seven Padma Vibhushan, 10 Padma Bhushan and 102 Padma Shri â were announced. Among the awardees are 29 women and one transgender, while 10 are foreigners, NRIs, persons of Indian origin or overseas citizens of India. Sixteen awards have been conferred posthumously. "Dom Raja" of Varanasi, Jagdish Chaudhary, who had signed PM Narendra Modiâs nomination papers in the 2019 LS poll, was also posthumously awarded Padma Shri for social work. Apart from Abe, who shares a good equation with Modi and is seen as a prime architect of the Indo-Pacific strategy, other foreign nationals share a strong India connect. UK filmmaker Peter Brooks, who made the well-received film "Mahabharata" based on his nine-hour play, and the late Father Valles, a Spanish Jesuit priest who lived and worked in Gujarat, have been honoured with Padma Shri. No Bharat Ratna was announced this year as well. The focus on low-profile achievers was best reflected in the selection of recipients from the art, culture and medicine categories, with many recipients hailing from the hinterland. The choice of the late Congress leader Gogoi, former CM of poll-bound Assam, is significant and will strike many as a shrewd move. B B Lal is another interesting pick in the Padma Vibhushan list. The reputed archaeologist was head of the ASI during an excavation in Ayodhya that was seen as yielding evidence of a Hindu temple â a determination which saw him being criticised by left historians but which strengthened VHPâs case for construction of a Ram Mandir at the disputed site. Three from the Sangh Parivar â former Gujarat CM Keshubhai Patel, Sumitra Mahajan and former governor Mridula Sinha, who passed away recently â too made the cut. The maximum 11 awards went to people from Tamil Nadu, incidentally another state headed for the polls. The Padma Vibhushan list included Puri-based sculptor Sudarshan Sahoo, cardiologist and Manipal University ex-chancellor B M Hegde, Islamic scholar Maulana Wahiduddin Khan and Indian-American Sikh physicist Narinder Singh Kapany, known for his work in the field of fibre optics. Playback singer K S Chithra was given the Padma Bhushan. Rattan Lal was awarded Padma Shri for regenerative agriculture. Pappammal from Coimbatore, who runs her own organic farm, was conferred Padma Shri. The 10 Padma Bhushan awardees include Islamic spiritual leader Kalbe Sadiq (posthumous), former MP and ex-chairman of National Commission for Minorities Tarlochan Singh, who has worked for the Sikh community, Kannada poet and playwright Chandrashekhar Kambara, and Maharashtra-based industrialist Rajnikant Devidas Shroff. In the Padma Shri list are former Union minister from Assam Bijoya Chakravarty. Among sportspersons in the Padma Shri list are basketball player P Anitha, table tennis player Mouma Das, athlete Sudha Hari Narayan Singh, para-sportsman K Y Venkatesh, wrestler Virender Singh and mountaineer Anshu Jamsenpa. The list, like the past few years, includes many unsung heroes in fields like art, social work, agriculture and also in a new category â grassroots innovation. From the field of trade and industry, Punjab-based Cremica founder Rajni Bector, late P Subramanian of Shanthi Gears based in Coimbatore who was also a philanthropist, and Zoho Corporation CEO Sridhar Vembu, have been conferred Padma Shri. Greek Indologist Nicholas Kazanas was awarded Padma Shri in the "literature and education" category, the former posthumously.

NEW DELHI: The Centre has asked all states and Union Territories to tighten security during Tuesday's 'Bharat Bandh' called by the farmers unions and supported by opposition parties, while asserting that peace and tranquillity must be maintained on that day, officials said. In a countrywide advisory, the Union Home Ministry also said the state governments and UT administrations must ensure that the Covid-19 guidelines issued with regard to health and social distancing are strictly followed. The 'Bharat Bandh' has been called by the farmers unions who have been protesting the three farm laws enacted in the Monsoon Session of Parliament. Major political parties on Sunday came out in strong support of the bandh. Here is all you want to know about new farm laws.  Key provisions of the lawsThe key provisions of new farm laws are intended to help small and marginal farmers (86% of total farmers) who donât have means to either bargain for their produce to get a better price or invest in technology to improve the productivity of farms. The Act on Agri market allows farmers to sell their produce outside APMC âmandisâ to whoever they want. Anyone can buy their produce even at their farm gates. Though âcommission agentsâ of the âmandisâ and states could lose 'commissions' and 'mandi fees' respectively (the main reasons for the current protests), farmers will get better prices through competition and cost-cutting on transportation.The law on contract farming will, on the other hand, allow farmers to enter into a contract with agri-business firms or large retailers on pre-agreed prices of their produce. This will help small and marginal farmers as the legislation will transfer the risk of market unpredictability from the farmer to the sponsor. The third law seeks to remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities. This provision will attract private sector/foreign direct investment into the agriculture sector.  What farmers fear:Farmer unions in Punjab and Haryana say the recent laws enacted at the Centre will dismantle the minimum support price (MSP) system. Over time big corporate houses will dictate terms and farmers will end up getting less for their crops, they argue. Farmers fear that with the virtual disbanding of the mandi system, they will not get an assured price for their crops and the âarthiyasâ -- commission agents who also pitch in with loans for them -- will be out of business. Farmers demands:The key demand is the withdrawal of the three laws which deregulate the sale of their crops. The farmer unions could also settle for a legal assurance that the MSP system will continue, ideally through an amendment to the laws.They are also pressing for the withdrawal of the proposed Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2020, fearing it will lead to an end to subsidised electricity. Farmers say rules against stubble burning should also not apply to them. How MSP affects farmersMSP is the minimum price paid by the government when it procures any crop from the farmers. It is announced by the state-run Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) for more than 22 commodities on an annual basis, after calculating the cost of cultivation. Food Corporation of India (FCI) -- which is the main state-run grain procurement agency -- largely buys only paddy and wheat at these prices. The FCI then sells these foodgrains at highly subsidised prices to the poor and is thereafter compensated by the government for its losses. What the government saysThe three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. Until 2020, the first sale of agriculture produce could occur only at the mandis of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC). However, after the Farmersâ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 came into force it allows farmers to sell outside APMC mandis in India.

The ban dates from last year when political tension between the neighbours rose over their disputed border. This month the Indian government decided to keep the ban on TikTok and other apps. "We urge the Indian side to immediately correct its discriminatory measures and avoid causing further damage to bilateral cooperation," Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong said in a statement.

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka will purchase 2 to 3 million doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from its Indian manufacturing company Serum Institute of India during the next two days, a top Sri Lankan official said here on Wednesday. Lalith Weeratunga, the advisor to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa said that purchasing from India will follow Thursday's arrival of India's free vaccines to Sri Lanka. He said the Indian Covishield vaccine is to arrive tomorrow and the consignment will be accepted by President Rajapaksa at the Colombo international airport. A total of 250,000 people, mostly health frontline workers, members of the security forces and police and the vulnerable aged, will get the vaccine on a priority basis. The vaccination programme for which dry runs were made over the weekend will commence on Friday. Weeratunga added that 300,000 free vaccines from China are also due and the government would be requesting Russia also for the vaccine. Sri Lanka has recorded a near 60,000 cases till January 26, with 288 deaths from the pandemic since it was found in the island nation in mid March last year. India is one of the world's biggest drug makers and an increasing number of countries have already approached it for procuring the coronavirus vaccines. In the last few days, India has sent consignments of domestically produced coronavirus vaccines under grant assistance to Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Mauritius and Seychelles. It is also undertaking commercial supplies of the doses to a number of countries, including Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Brazil and Morocco.

NEW DELHI: An Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) study on Covaxin shows a comparable neutralization activity of the vaccinated individuals against UK-variant strain. The ICMR's National Institute of Virology scientist performed the plaque reduction neutralization test using sera collected from the 26 recipients of Bharat Biotech's coronavirus vaccine (Covaxin) against UK-variant strain. "A comparable neutralization activity of the vaccinated individuals sera showed against UK-variant and the heterologous strain with similar efficiency dispel the uncertainty of possible neutralization escape," stated document appeared in bioRxiv in a pre-print version. Amid efficacy row, Covaxin gets thumbs-up from Lancet"We successfully isolated and characterized the SARS-CoV-2 from UK returnees in India with all signature mutations of the UK-variant," noted the NIV- Pune scientist. "We present the neutralizing antibodies (Nab) titers to underline the efficacy of Covaxin vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 UK-variant and one of the heterologous strains. Sera collected from 38 vaccine recipients, who received Covaxin vaccine-candidate in phase-II trial had equivalent NAb titers to homologous strain and two heterologous strains with the characteristic substitution of the UK-variant," said the authors. "The median ratio of 50 per cent neutralization of sera was found to be 0.8 and 0.9 when compared with earlier detected SARS CoV-2 strains against mutant UK strain," they said. "Our study evidently highlighted comparable neutralization activity of vaccinated individuals sera against variant as well as heterologous SARS-CoV-2 strains." "Importantly, sera from the vaccine recipients could neutralise the UK-variant strains discounting the uncertainty around potential escape. It was reassuring from the neutralizing antibodies data generated in our laboratory that the indigenous Covaxin following its rollout in the vaccination program, could be expected to work against the new UK-variant. It is unlikely that the mutation would be able to dampen the potential benefits of the vaccine in concern," it said. The ICMR scientist mentioned that they have reported the development of an inactivated whole-virion SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Covaxin) which elicited remarkable neutralizing antibody response in phase I clinical trial against homologous, and two heterologous strains from the unclassified cluster. In phase II clinical trial, the vaccine candidate showed noteworthy results with plaque reduction neutralization test. The sero-conversion rate with neutralizing antibodies following vaccination with Covaxin was 99.6 per cent. It is pertinent to note that the rapid surge in SARS-CoV-2 cases due to the Variant of Concern (VOC) in the United Kingdom (UK) raised concerns in several countries.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed the acquittal order of the accused in the case where Nagpur Bench of Bombay High Court had said that groping a minor's breast without "skin to skin contact" can't be termed as sexual assault. The case dates back to February 2020 when a 39-year-old man in Nagpur had been charged for pressing the breasts of a minor. A trial court in Nagpur had sentenced the accused to three yearsâ imprisonment under section 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) and under section 354 IPC (assault or criminal force with intent to outrage a womanâs modesty). Not sex assault if thereâs no skin-to-skin contact: Bombay HCThe man had appealed his conviction following which the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court acquitted the man ruling that âno direct physical contact â skin to skin with sexual intent, without penetration" would not amount to âsexual assaultâ under Pocso Act. Why did the Bombay High Court acquit the man?The HC said the issue before it was whether âpressing of the breastâ and âattempt to remove salwarâ would fall within the definition of âsexual assaultâ as defined under Section 7 and punishable under Section 8 of the Pocso Act. While public prosecutor MJ Khan argued the offence fell within the definition of âsexual assaultâ, the HC held it was ânot possible to acceptââ the prosecutorâs submission. The court said the âbasic principle of criminal jurisprudence is that punishment shall be proportional to the seriousness of the crimeâ. Justice Pushpa Ganediwala of Nagpur bench had said âstricter proof and serious allegations are requiredââ given the stringent punishment of three to five yearsâ imprisonment that âsexual assaultâ under the Pocso Act entails. The HC convicted the man for a âminor offenceâ and sentenced him to one year in jail overruling trial court's three years of punishment. The man was on bail. The HC issued a non-bailable warrant against him and said all his other sentences shall run concurrently and he would be entitled for a set-off of term undergone in custody. Mother found daughter crying inside a bolted roomThe minor had testified that she was lured on a false pretext by the accused to his house. She said he had tried to remove her salwar and had pressed her breast. She tried to shout, but he covered her mouth and left the room after bolting the door from outside. Her mother went to his house while looking for her. She had seen the accused leave, and on reaching the first floor found the door bolted from outside and her daughter crying inside. She then went to the police station along with her daughter to lodge an FIR, noted the HC.

NEW DELHI: Twitter on Wednesday said it suspended more than 300 accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation as the farmers' tractor rally went violent in the national capital on the 72nd Republic Day. The farmers swarmed the Red Fort and waved farmer union flags from its ramparts. They even hoisted farmer union flags as well as a pennant with a Sikh religious symbol from a flagpole. A Twitter spokesperson told IANS that the company has taken strong enforcement action to protect the conversation on the service from attempts to incite violence, abuse and threats that could trigger the risk of offline harm by blocking certain terms that violate our rules for trends.

HYDERABAD: The pandemic may have slowed down the global economy, but it hasnât slowed down emerging technologies and their demand. If anything, Covid-19 has pressed the fast-forward button for engineering students all set to graduate and looking for a job. Companies that reached the IITs and other top engineering colleges in the country for campus placements increasingly asked for students who could tackle data science, machine learning (ML), internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, blockchain, and design thinking. âEmerging technologies are growing at a fast pace and so do human resources requirements in these fields. This year, placements for students with a profile in emerging technologies have been better than last year,â said Pradeep Kumar Yemula, faculty-in-charge, office of career services at IIT, Hyderabad (IIT-H). With the phase 2 recruitment process still going on, the training and placement officers at top institutes said that the final job offer numbers are expected to grow further. Some institutes have already crossed last yearâs figures when it comes to offers in emerging technologies. While 21 job offers in emerging technologies were made to students of IIT Guwahati during the year 2019-20, this year students have already received 23 offers â 18 in data sciences, three in ML, and two in AI. The average salary in emerging tech has increased from approximately Rs 22.3 lakh last year to Rs 24.2 lakh this year. âEmerging technologies showed growth and we expect this trend to continue in the future,â said Abhishek Kumar, head, centre for career development, IIT Guwahati. C S Shankar Ram, advisor (training & placement), IIT Madras, said, âPhase 1 placements at IIT Madras went on well with good participation from companies in the AI/ML/data science sector. We expect this trend of active participation from companies in this sector to continue in the next few years,â With placements going digital, institutes like Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani- Hyderabad campus, even hired expert trainers from the industry to help students to gear up for digital mode interviews and interactions.

UNITED NATIONS: India has announced a pledge of $150,000 to activities of the Peacebuilding Fund this year and said that 2021 provides the international community with an opportunity to look at peacebuilding in a more focused manner, especially in the context of the Covid pandemic. âWhile I would like to assure you all of our sincere commitment to remain engaged in peacebuilding, we extend our support to the activities of the Peacebuilding Fund and as a token of our engagement, India would like to announce today a pledge of $150,000 to the fund's activities and programme this year,â India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti said. In a virtual address to the High-Level Replenishment Conference for the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund Tuesday, he said India believes that 2021 provides the international community with an opportunity to look at peacebuilding in the broader context and in a more focused manner, especially in the context of the Covid pandemic, which is threatening to erode the gains made over the years. He added that the recently concluded 2020 review of the UN peacebuilding architecture provides a framework to strengthen peace building collectively. He voiced appreciation that as a part of its 2020-24 strategy, the Peacebuilding Fund has put forth a comprehensive scenario covering a horizon of five years. The Fund requires 1.5 billion dollars for 2020-2024. âThere is no doubt that conflict prevention is essential to ensure that peacekeeping translates into something more durable for the benefit of the people,â he said, adding that for this determined support is needed from member states to strengthen the hands of the United Nations. He emphasised that strengthening security structures go hand in hand with strengthening civilian structures of good governance. âWe need to consequently prioritise our focus on specific aspects of peacebuilding, which will have the highest impact in post-conflict situations, so that the funds are utilised to the optimum.â UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said at the conference that peacebuilding in fragile contexts requires political courage and leadership at national and local levels, but also the right support at the right time from the international community. âWe need to take risks for peace and enable stakeholders with the resources and space to seize opportunities. We have a responsibility to bring down the institutional silos and bring together, in an agile and responsive manner, the full range of the UN system capacities,â he said. The UN chief pointed out that as the medium-term effects of the COVID19 pandemic become more apparent, it is more important than ever to ensure the fund is adequately and predictably resourced. In 2020, the Peacebuilding Fund mobilised over $180 million, which Guterres said is an important sign of the trust the fund has garnered over the years and its demonstrated ability to deliver in the most difficult contexts. "But its resources are now depleted. We must urgently replenish it. Doing so will save lives and serve as a clear demonstration of multilateral support.â Tirumurti highlighted India's constructive and significant role in the context of peacebuilding through its extensive development partnership in developing countries, particularly in Africa and Asia. India continues to assist countries bilaterally in post-conflict situations by providing substantial grants and soft loans, apart from focusing on infrastructure, especially housing, education and health, on connectivity, providing livelihood to those impacted by conflict, especially in agriculture and on projects at the grassroots level. He cited the example from Afghanistan, where India has undertaken projects in every province of the country. India has tried to enhance the security environment of these countries since peace, security and development have to go together. India is also fulfilling its commitment to make available its Covid-19 vaccines to other countries and has already supplied more than six million doses to nine countries in phase one as grant assistance. The Peacebuilding Fund is the UN's financial instrument of first resort to sustain peace in countries or situations at risk or affected by violent conflict. The Fund's 2020-2024 strategy is its most ambitious yet, responding to the Secretary-General's call for a quantum leap of support for peacebuilding and prevention. The Fund has invested over $1.2 billion to date in over 60 countries, with support from almost 60 member states. At the close of the conference, the co-chairs issued a Joint Communique stating that the General Assembly would convene a High-Level meeting on financing peace during its 76th session. "The Conference took place at a time of unprecedented challenges and as the world contends with the tragic immediate effects of the pandemic and its alarming medium to long-term impacts. The unprecedented economic shocks and inadequate response strategies are entrenching social and economic inequalities and increasing risks for crisis, eroding peace and development gains along the way," the Joint Communique said. Member states reiterated the importance of investing in peace. Including funds received for 2020, a total of 39 member states have contributed or pledged over $439 million for peacebuilding in support of the Fund's 2020-2024 Strategy which set a target of $1.5 billion.

NEW DELHI: Farmer leaders have alleged that Punjabi singer and actor Deep Sidhu instigated protesters and led them to the iconic Red Fort and hoisted flags in the 17th-century monument. Famous for his role as a gangster in the Punjabi film âJora Das Numberiaâ in 2018, the 36-year-old was one of the first celebrities to support farmers when they took to the roads against the three laws. Sidhu, who claims to be a supporter of strengthening the federal structure to give more rights to states, has long been openly quoting Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. Red Fort raider Deep Sidhu has been quoting Jarnail Singh BhindranwaleLast month, the NIA registered a case against Sikhs for Justice and had also issued notices to Sidhu and his brother Mandeep Singh. Considered close to Sikh ideologue Ajmer Singh, Sidhu practised as a lawyer before joining the show business in 2015. Sidhu also did a Facebook live while hoisting the pennant from the ramparts of the Red Fort. In the video, Sidhu said in Punjabi, "We have only hoisted the Nishan Sahib flag on the Red Fort while exercising our democratic right to protest." Deep Sidhu &amp; government agencies behind rampage: Farm netasDeep Sidhu belong to Muktsar in Punjab and had held a prolonged protest at the Shambhu border between Punjab and Haryana, where accusations of Khalistani elements running the protests had been made. During the Lok Sabha elections in May 2019, Deep Sidhu was in the news for being close to Bollywood actor-politician Sunny Deol, who contested from Gurdaspur as a BJP candidate. However, Deol distanced himself from Sidhu in a tweet, saying he or his family had no relationship with him. "I am deeply saddened by what happened at the Red Fort today. On December 6 itself, I had clarified on Twitter that I and my family have nothing to do with Deep Sidhu.

Huge relief for spouses of H-1B workers, Biden nixes Trump plan to kill H-4 work permits

NEW YORK: "Withdrawn". A single word on a thick bureaucratic file on the seventh day of the Biden administration delivered a huge win for spouses of workers on H-1B visas in the US who spent the last four years worried sick that their work authorisations would be killed off. The latest development brings to an end years of effort by the Donald Trump administration to rescind an Obama era regulation that allowed a certain subset of spouses of H-1B visa holders to work in the US. Up until the summer of 2015, H-4 visa holders could not legally hold paid employment in the United States. Almost as soon as Obama changed the game, the lawsuits followed and then the Trump presidency took the attack on the H-4 work permit to a whole new level. On text messages, chat groups and online threads, the outpouring of relief played out online on Tuesday evening. "Great news! Hopefully H4EAD delays will be ending soon which is leading to a long wait for dependent spouses," tweeted Rashi Bhatnagar. Sharmistha Mohapatra posted, "Big win for H4 EAD holders today. Former Pres Trump's EO to rescind H4 EAD is now withdrawn by POTUS. Let's hope excruciating long wait times often resulting in job loss is taken away too!" From the time the skewering of the H-4 work permit (called the EAD) began in Fall 2017, the proposed rule has been published seven times for ongoing review, keeping the H-4 community on cliff-edge. The Trump government justified the move saying it is "economically significant" and aligns with the "Buy American and Hire American" executive order, which was mostly code for keeping foreign workers out of the US and flinging red meat to the Trump base. Now, the backlink to that Trump executive order ends up as a 404 (page not found) error and re-routes to the Biden White House. "Removing H-4 Dependent Spouses from the Class of Aliens Eligible for Employment Authorization" was a Trumpian agenda pursued by White House immigration hawks with intense zeal and inter-agency collaboration. It was being reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), where it was parked for months. The pressure on the H4 community never really let up since Trump took office. The decision to rescind the proposed rule on revoking the H4 work permit came on the same day Biden signed an executive order calling for the practice of racial equity in the United States. Data from the US government show that Indian and Chinese workers account for the lion's share of H-1B visas. H-4 visas typically follow the same trajectory. Indians filed 74 per cent of all H-1B petitions in fiscal year 2019. Chinese filed 11.8 per cent.

NEW DELHI: The world is on verge of defeating the coronavirus pandemic by adopting preemptive, proactive and collaborative strategies to combat the virus, said Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday. "I thank member nations that despite the wide disparity in their epidemiological trends, we're on verge of defeating pandemic by adopting preemptive, proactive and collaborative strategies," said the Union health minister at 148th session of WHO Executive Board (virtual) meeting. Speaking about the year that was marred by the pandemic, he said, "2020 was the year of science when the best of humanity was shown through the gloom that descended due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The situation demanded setting up of major global collaboration so that scientists could share their expertise. For these governments, business and philanthropic organisations got together to start committing resources." On the efforts being undertaken globally to fight Covid-19, Harsh Vardhan added: "All member states are doing their utmost to overcome challenges and improve the accessibility, affordability and quality of health care services. But the job isn't finished here. So we must redouble our commitment to putting an end to the pandemic." "In the present context, nowhere is safe until everywhere is safe. At the WHO, we have ensured that the low and middle-income countries have access to safe and effective Covid-19 tests, treatment and vaccine." Over the post-Covid world, he said, "The post-Covid world will be filled with challenges. To overcome them, WHO needs to be a trailblazer, empowered to work towards a new vision that allows it to realise its full potential and strengthen health care systems across member nations." Harsh Vardhan's statement comes as the worldwide tally of Covid-19 cases surpassed the 100 million mark on Wednesday, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The United States continues to be the worst affected country with 25,407,414 cases.

NEW DELHI: Robust ambulance services and highway patrol teams can reduce road deaths drastically as was evident in Tamil Nadu where road crash fatalities fell by 54% in 4 years â from 17,218 fatalities in 2016 to 7,287 in 2020. While Rajasthan, Karnataka and Kerala are keen to adopt the Tamil Nadu model, Maharashtra on Tuesday announced to implement it. Venkatesh Balasubramanian of IIT-M on Tuesday said even if the 2020 road crash and death data are not taken into consideration because of the lockdown, Tamil Nadu has been recording continuous decline in fatalities since 2016. Now the road transport ministry and World Bank will propagate the TN model â identifying the exact cause of fatalities, ambulance reaching site within 13 minutes, rectifying crash spots and smooth coordination among various agencies â which others can adopt to check the number of road deaths. The state deploys ambulances after identifying accident-prone locations, which has reduced response time considerably. Balasubramanian said one of the focuses is to save as many lives as possible in case of any crash. India loses 415 lives per day in road crashes, the most across the globe. âIf we keep waiting till 2030, at least 6-7 lakh people will die due to road accidents. If Tamil Nadu can do it, all states can make progress,â Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari said while launching the month-long Road Safety campaign. Elaborating about Tamil Nadu, a state transport department official said the steps include collection of robust data on accidents, identifying and elimination of âblack spotsâ, providing emergency response and healthcare, educating drivers on safe driving and enforcement by police and the transport wing. The state transport minister holds a meeting of all wings concerned on road safety every third month and the collector of each district chairs a meeting every month. Performance on the road safety front has been made a critical input while analysing the performance of field officers in their annual performance reports. Times View: Tamil Nadu must be congratulated for coming up with a successful model that helps reduce road deaths. It would be even better if other states adopt this model, with necessary local tweaks. India is the worldâs road death capital. The sooner the tag is lost, the better.

Protests by farmers and their supporters against the agri-marketing laws were by and large peaceful in states like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Telangana. In Karnataka, there were tractors rallies of varying size in support of the protest in Delhi. Members of some 50 outfits participated in a demonstration in Bengaluru that involved 125 tractors and other vehicles under the Aikhya (United) Forum. There were a few reports of minor skirmishes with the police from other parts of the state, while some farmersâ groups threatened to intensify the agitation on the lines of the Delhi stir if the Centre failed to withdraw the laws. Over 5,000 tractors headed towards Bengaluru were stopped. Federation of Farmersâ Associations Kurubur Shanthkumar warned of a larger agitation. â In Telangana, hundreds of people chanting âJai Jawan Jai Kisanâ hit the streets in Hyderabad. Organised by the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, the rally comprised participants from the Left parties, civil rights groups and womenâs groups. The tractor rally at the Shahjahanpur-Kherhi border in Haryanaâs Rewari district saw farmers, labourers, fishermen and tribals from seven states participate. The rally, which began at Rewari after tricolour was unfurled at the venue, reached Manesar via Bawal and returned by the same route without any controversial incident. It included 26 makeshift tableaux on trolleys highlighting the art, culture, heritage and source of income of 26 states. âHum iss tractor parade se dil jeetne aaye hain, naa ki Dilli jeetne (We want to win the hearts of people with this parade, not Delhi),â Samyukta Morcha local coordinator Sanjay Madhav said. In Mumbai, protesters headed home after flag-hoisting at Azad Maidan, the All India Kisan Sabha said. In Tamil Nadu, farmers and trade union members ignored warnings from police and took out rallies on tractors and twowheelers involving several people in Thanjavur, Nagapattinam, Tiruvaur and Trichy.

NEW DELHI: With events around âKisan Republic Day Paradeâ going against their proclaimed script of peaceful protest, farm unionsâ umbrella body, Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), on Tuesday disassociated itself from violent incidents in the heart of the capital and blamed âsome organisations and individualsâ for violating the planned routes and indulging in âcondemnableâ acts. âAntisocial elements have infiltrated the otherwise peaceful movement. We have always held that peace is our biggest strength, and that any violation would hurt the movement,â said the Morcha in a statement, issued after hundreds of protesters jumped police barricades and reached ITO and Red Fort in central Delhi. As the protesters stationed themselves at various sites in the city, SKM called off the âKisan Republic Day Paradeâ on Tuesday evening and appealed to all participants to immediately return to their respective protest sites on Delhi borders â Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri. It said the âmovement will continue peacefully and further steps will be discussed and decided soonâ. SKM leaders later said the events on Tuesday would not affect their plan to hold a protest march on foot towards Parliament on the Budget Day on February 1. Though the Morcha has not identified the organisations and individuals responsible for violence during the tractor rally, leaders hinted at those associated with Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) â the group which had rejected the route plan finalised by SKM with Delhi Police on the eve of the Republic Day. KMSCâs Punjab unit general secretary Sarvan Singh Pandher had on Monday announced to start its parade towards Outer Ring Road at 8am on Tuesday â ahead of SKMâs agreed plan to start the tractor rally after conclusion of the official parade at Rajpath. Regretting the âundesirable and unacceptable eventsâ, the SKM said, âWe dissociate ourselves from all such elements that have violated our discipline.â

Kerala accounted for nearly half of all fresh Covid-19 cases recorded in India on Tuesday, as the pandemic continued to rage in the state while receding from most other parts of the country. Kerala logged 6,293 new cases on Tuesday, back above the 6,000 mark after a day's gap. In the rest of the country put together, 6,445 fresh cases were recorded, with data from Chandigarh yet to be received till late on Tuesday. A total of 12,673 cases were recorded on the day, up from Mondayâs seven-month-low of 9,110. In the weekly cycle, however, Tuesdayâs case count was a decline of over 1,100 as on the same day last week (January 19) the country had reported 13,821 fresh cases. There were 135 deaths from the pandemic on Tuesday (without Chandigarh data), a rise from the previous dayâs count of 117. As compared to last weekâs numbers, deaths continued to show a decline. Maharashtra reported 2,405 cases, the second highest in the country. With 47 deaths recorded in the last 24 hours, the state again led the country in fatalities, followed by Kerala (19 deaths), Chhattisgarh (14) and Punjab (11). Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh reported 172 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, with the recovery rate touching 99% in eight districts of the state.

UNITED NATIONS: India has informed the UN Security Council that it will gradually supply vaccines to the Covax facility of the World Health Organisation and undertake contractual supplies to various countries in a phased manner, as more than six million doses have been airlifted to nine countries under New Delhiâs âvaccine diplomacy.â âAs the largest vaccine-producing country of the world, we are fulfilling our commitment to make our vaccine production and delivery capacity available for the benefit of the entire humanity,â Indiaâs deputy permanent representative to the UN ambassador K Nagaraj Naidu said on Monday. Speaking at the UNSC briefing on âMaintenance of international peace and security : Follow-up on the implementation of resolution 2532â, Naidu said two vaccines have already been granted approval for emergency use in India and the country plans to vaccinate about 300 million citizens in the first six months. Covax is the global initiative to ensure rapid and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for all countries, regardless of income level. Sri Lanka thanks India for sending vaccineSri Lanka on Tuesday expressed appreciation and gratitude to India for sending 500,000 doses of coronavirus vaccine to the island country. Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa told the cabinet that the Indian high commissioner in Colombo informed that India would be sending 500,000 vaccines to Sri Lanka and they will arrive here on January 28. âThe cabinet of ministers decided to express the appreciation and gratitude of the Sri Lankan government in this regard," a Cabinet note said. Sri Lanka will become the eighth country to which India is gifting Covid-19 vaccines since it began its country-wide mega immunisation programme on January 16. Vax nationalism dangerous for world: SA presidentWarning against dangers of âvaccine nationalismâ, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday said everyone canât be safe if some countries vaccinate their people and others are not able to do so. Speaking at the World Economic Forumâs online Davos Agenda Summit, he said, âThe challenges we face were not created by the virus, they were created by usâ. The South African President said poverty, destruction of environment and conflict are âall the results of our own action, and â too often âour inactionâ. He called for forging a new path, saying the task is not to return the world to where it was when the pandemic struck.

NEW DELHI: A new report highlights that women are likely to bear the brunt of job losses during the pandemic because much of their work is invisible, and they are likely to work in informal work arrangements. An Oxfam India report â âThe Inequality Virusâ in a section on livelihood draws upon reports and data to point that women who were employed before the lockdown are also 23.5 percentage points less likely to be re-employed compared to men in the post-lockdown phase. The report cites different data sets, reports and surveys to underline the increasing inequalities in the backdrop of the pandemic in a wide range of sectors and the growing gaps in sectors like education, health and livelihood among others. In a section on âWomen bear the Bruntâ, it is pointed that 17 million women lost their jobs in April 2020. Therefore, unemployment for women rose by 15% from a pre-lockdown level of 18%. This increase in unemployment of women can result in a loss to Indiaâs GDP of about 8% or $218 billion. It is also pointed that the work-from-home culture has also blurred the lines between working hours and personal downtime. Women have been working longer hours and simultaneously managing the daily chores of the household, the educational needs of the children and care for all members of the family. The report said frontline health workers such as ASHAs (Accredited Social Health Activists) whose work can be seen as an extension of care work have experienced a phenomenal increase in their work. âBut the remuneration is way too measly â a mere Rs 1,000 for the Covid-19 duties assigned to them. It is estimated that if Indiaâs top 11 billionaires are taxed at just 1% on their wealth, the government can pay the average wage of the nine lakh ASHA workers in the country for 5 years,â said the report. Reflecting on the overall scenario, the report highlights that the economic fallout of the pandemic manifested in job losses and salary cuts for both informal and formal sectors. âThe job loss for the low-income households with no other alternative earnings and no social security has been the most troubling and will find it extremely difficult to cope with and recover from the slowdown,â pointed out the report.

NEW DELHI: After another border face-off between India and China, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday called for the two countries to dial down tensions through dialogue. "Only to say that we hope that, through dialogue, the tensions that may exist along the border could be dialled down," Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the UN Secretary-General, said at a news briefing. Dujarric was responding to a question on whether the UN Secretariat or the Secretary General had any comment on the "renewed India-China border clashes". Indian and Chinese troops were involved in a clash in the high-altitude Naku La region in North Sikkim on January 20, an incident described by the Indian Army on Monday as a "minor face-off". In a statement, the Indian Army said the face-off was resolved by local commanders as per established protocols. Chinese authorities though have denied any knowledge about the incident claiming that the PLA didn't have any record of the clash.

NEW DELHI: A 122-member Bangladesh contingent, two IAF women pilots, newly acquired multi-role fighter aircraft Rafales, troops deployed in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and a tableau of newly constituted UT of Ladakh were among the novelties at the 72nd Republic Day parade on Rajpath on Tuesday. However, for the first time in over five decades, the parade had no foreign dignitary as chief guest as British PM Boris Johnson cancelled his visit due to the Covid situation in his country. Also, there was no participation of military veterans and motorcycle-borne daredevils who used to be one of the paradeâs main attractions in past years. Due to Covid restrictions, even the route of the marching contingents was curtailed till National Stadium instead of Red Fort. Even the size of the marching contingents was reduced from regular 144 to 96 so as to keep social distancing among personnel while masks was made mandatory for them. Despite Covid-triggered restrictions, enthusiasm among the spectators was not missing. The armed forces showcased their latest weaponry like T-90 tanks, Brahmos missile system, Pinaka multiple launch rocket system, bridge -laying T-72 tank, integrated communication electronic warfare system and one upgraded Schilka weapon system. Some of these systems are currently deployed in Ladakh to prevent any Chinese incursion. Two Param Vir Chakra and one Ashok Chakra awardees participated in this parade, which was led by parade commander Lt Gen Vijay Kumar Mishra, general officer commanding Delhi Area, and his second-in-command Major General Alok Kacker, chief of staff, Delhi Area. The 122-member Bangladesh military personnel marched in two groupsâ one marching contingent and a military band. The marching contingent comprised personnel from three services and was led by a flight lieutenant, navy lieutenant, one Major and 3 Lt Colonels. This was the third time India hosted a foreign contingent to participate in the parade after the French troops in 2016 and UAE personnel in 2017. Seventeen marching contingents from the armed forces, paramilitary, Delhi Police, NSG, NCC and NSS along with 15 military bands participated in the parade. The Indian Army was represented by a mounted column of 61 Cavalry, seven mechanised columns and six marching contingents. The 172 Madras contingent from the Andamans also participated in the parade for the first time. âFor the first time, any contingent from the (A&N) islands is participating in such a big event on the mainland and therefore boys are very excited. Over 95% personnel are locals who are from different tribes. Our unit, which is part of Madras Regiment, was raised for the sons of the soil and its objective is to create a robust intelligence in the area.â The contingent comprised 96 personnel, 2 JCOs and one officer, said Major Verma. Flight Lieutenant Bhawana Kanth, who became the first woman combat pilot to participate in the parade, took a salute in front of President Ram Nath Kovind when her IAF tableau featuring mock-ups of an LCA, a light combat helicopter and a Sukhoi fighter loaded with made-in-India missiles passed by the VVIP enclosure. The Indian Navyâs tableau showcased models of Indian naval ship (INS) Vikrant and naval operations that were conducted during the 1971 India-Pakistan war. The DRDO showed two tableaux, one showcasing Tejas' successful take-off from aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya, and another displaying full complement of the anti-tank guided missile systems. A total of 28 tableaux from different states and departments rolled down Rajpath. Among them was the tableau of Ladakh that made its debut in the parade. It depicted the iconic Thikse Monastery, the regionâs rich cultural heritage and the vision of Ladakh to be carbon-neutral. The UP tableau displayed a model of the upcoming Ram Templeand the tableau of the Department of Biotechnology showcased the indigenous production of Covid vaccines highlighting Indiaâs self-reliance in the fight against the pandemic. While the tableau of ministry of electronics & IT was inspired by the theme 'Digital India, Aatma-Nirbhar Bharat', the labour ministry tableau showed the segments benefiting the most from 'Labour Codes'. The centre of attraction of the 90-minute parade was IAF's display of the countryâs air prowess amid times of the LAC stand-off with China. A vintage Dakota aircraft which had flown troops to âsaveâ Srinagar from attack by tribal militia backed by the Pakistan Army in 1947 and also played a key role in Bangladesh's liberation war, also flew over Rajpath. Another IAF woman pilot Flight Lieutenant Swati Rathore got the honour to be the first woman to be part of this yearâs flypast when she flew a Mi-17 V5 helicopter. A total of 42 aircraft flew in different formations but all eyes were on the Rafale fighter when it performed a âvertical charlieâ at the end of the flypast. Apart from two Rafales, Sukhoi-30s, MiG-29s, Apache and Chinook choppers also drew visitorsâ attention.

UNITED NATIONS: India and three other G4 nations seeking a permanent seat in the UN Security Council have asserted that the format of the inter-governmental negotiations (IGN) on UNSC reforms can be saved only if there is a single negotiating text and application of the General Assembly rules of procedure. Participating in the first IGN meeting on the UNSC reforms in the 75th session of the General Assembly on Monday, India, Brazil, Japan and Germany underlined that without the two, it can no longer be the forum where the long-pending amendments can ârealistically be achievedâ. During the meeting, they said only two things can save the IGN as a format â negotiations of a single text with attributions, reflecting various positions taken by member states in the last 12 years and the application of the General Assembly rules of procedure. âIf these two things cannot be achieved this year, the IGN will have run its course for us,â Germanyâs Christoph Heusgen said, making a statement on behalf of the G4 nations.

Indiaâs public broadcaster has now signed an agreement with International Television Broadcasting LLC (ITV) of the US, which has a strong presence in the territories of North America, South America and the Caribbean (namely, Guyana, Trinidad & Tobago, Suriname and Jamaica and Barbados, among others). âDissemination of Indian view on world affairs among Asian diaspora and Caribbean communities has been minimal. With our plans to distribute DD India thru ITV in whole of USA and parts of Caribbean, this gap will be filled. DD India will be immediately available in the Tri-state area (NY, NJ and Connecticut),â said Sudhir Parikh, chairman, ITV. Thus, audiences in the Americas will have the opportunity to see and experience the emergence of a new self-reliant India through the DD India, the global news and current affairs channel of Doordarshan. The chief India correspondent of ITV C Anand Velayudhan remarked, âepistemic trespassing by individuals on social media had left Indian origin people in a quandary.

AYODHYA: Unfurling of the tricolour and tree plantation on Indiaâs 72nd Republic Day marked the formal launch of the Ayodhya mosque project at Dhannipur village, 25km off Ramjanmabhoomi, exactly six months after the Sunni Waqf Board constituted the mosque trust â Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation â following the 2019 Supreme Court verdict that mandated construction of a temple at Ramjanmabhoomi and a mosqut in the district in lieu of the Babri Masjid. The tricolour was hoisted by trust chairman Zufar Ahmad Farooqui, and nine saplings were planted at the site by its members amid cheer from villagers of Dhannipur, a nondescript hamlet which catapulted into fame after a 5-acre plot adjacent to a century-old Sufi shrine was allotted for the mosque. Holding afloat Ayodhyaâs secular and syncretic moorings, three members of the Hindu community, including a prominent RSS functionary made generous donations for mosque construction on the occasion. While professor RK Singh of Awadh University and his wife Dr Sunita Sengar donated Rs 22,000, RSS member Dr Anil Singh, who is also president of Ayodhyaâs Muslim Rashtriya Manch, donated Rs 2,100. To recall, the first donation of Rs 21,000 for the mosque project came from a Hindu academic from Lucknow University, Rohit Srivastava, last year. Talking to TOI, Singh said, âMajority Hindus will support construction of this mosque in Ayodhya along with the temple at Ramjanmabhoomi and this is the best example of communal harmony.â Talking to TOI, trust secretary Athar Hussain, said, âThe trust chose January 26 for laying the foundation of the mosque as on this day the Constitution came into effect more than seven decades ago.â The new mosque will be bigger than Babri masjid, but wonât be a lookalike of the structure which once stood in Ramjanmabhoomi premises. âThe hospital will hold centrestage and will serve humanity in the true spirit of Islam as taught by the prophet 1,400 years ago,â Farooqui said.

MHOW: A missed salute alerted Army intelligence to an imposter, dressed in the uniform of a Bihar Regiment jawan, in Mhow cantonment on Republic Day. The suspect, 24-year-old Mithun Verma, was taking pictures of different areas of the cantonment in Indore district when he was nabbed, said Mhow sub-divisional police officer Vinod Sharma. When Mithun was clicking photos of the Infantry Museum on Mall Road, an officer was passing by and noticed that the âsepoyâ did not salute him, said sources. His suspicions aroused, the officer checked Mithun and began asking questions. The Bihar Regiment badge on the imposterâs beret was inverted and he wasnât able to answer where he was posted at present. The officer alerted intelligence officials and an Army quick reaction team swiftly took him into custody. Mithun carried colour photographs of a fake identity card and the CSD canteen card of a soldier on his mobile phone, Sharma said. âArmy and police found that he had three sets of brand new Army uniforms and his mobile had pictures of soldiers posted at Mhow. Our investigation is on,â he added. Upon interrogation, he confessed that he worked as a private security guard in an aluminum factory in Pithampur industrial area, police said. He is a native of Kodiakhedi village in Rajgarh district, some 200km from Mhow. Sources said that Mithun had tried to join the armed forces but couldnât make it past the selection stage. Then, he started posing as a soldier with the 10 Bihar Regiment before villagers and his own family. Army officers are interrogating Mithun to trace the source of the forged IDs. tnn

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: NCP president Sharad Pawar on Tuesday said he would appeal to the agitating farmers to go back to their respective villages peacefully so that there was no scope for the Narendra Modi government to blame them in the wake of mishandling of the situation in the Capital. Pawar reacted sharply to the handling of the agitation and said, âThe Centre is determined to ignore the agitation and hence there was no dialogue between the agitating farmers and nominees of the government. Whatever happened in New Delhi today, no one will endorse, but it was high time to study why such a situation arose. All out efforts were made to crush the agitation by using massive force. It will have massive repercussions. We have seen Punjab disturbed, now it is the responsibility of the Modi government to ensure that Punjab remains peaceful.â The veteran pointed out that ever since the farmersâ agitation began in New Delhi, it had remained apolitical and it was expected that the government would initiate dialogue and find an amicable solution, but the government was determined to crush the agitation. âIn Mumbai, thousands of farmers had gathered to support agitating farmers in New Delhi, but the law-enforcing agencies in Maharashtra observed restraint. As a result, it was a peaceful agitation,â he added. Launching a frontal attack on the Modi government, Pawar said the Centre introduced the three legislations in Parliament without adequate consultations. âProper procedure should have been followed, all sections should have been taken into confidence,â he said. Other opposition parties too condemned the clashes but said the Centre was squarely responsible for allowing the protests to fester. Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee condemned the clashes with similar caveats. âCentreâs insensitive attitude and indifference towards our farmer brothers and sisters has to be blamed. First, three laws were passed without taking farmers in confidence. And then, despite protests across India and farmers camping near Delhi for two months, theyâve been extremely casual in dealing with them,â she said. Left members, who have backed the protests, also joined the march on Tuesday. CPMâs Sitaram Yechury condemned all violence but demanded that the PM announce immediate repeal of the laws. âThe republic is of the public. The tantra in âganatantraâ has no meaning without the âganaâ. The protests are for a legitimate demand of millions of farmers, that remains the issue at hand and must be resolved.â

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said violence was not the solution to any problem even as he called for the new farm laws to be withdrawn, reflecting the party's determination to back the agitation and the farm organisations protesting the legislations. Congress's position was, however, modified in a late evening statement that seemed to take into account the negative fallout of the violence, including a raid on the Red Fort on Republic Day. "The protesters should keep their objective in mind. Non-violence and satyagraha have been the biggest success of this protest led by farmers and workers. We strongly hope that this coalition of farmers, workers and the poor will continue on its path of non-violence and peaceful protest and stay firm for the repeal of the three farm laws,â the party said. The worry in Congress ranks was that violence on Republic Day would undercut any sympathy gained over the last four months by peaceful protests. There was nervousness over a religious flag hoisted on the Red Fort ramparts by some protesters. Rahul, in a tweet early in the day, said, âViolence is not the solution to any problem. If anyone gets hurt, the damage will happen to our country. Take back the anti-agricultural law for the benefit of the country.â Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh voiced concern over the violence most directly when he called the development âshocking scenes in Delhiâ. He suggested the violence was carried out by âsome elementsâ who were not âgenuine farmersâ, and that farmersâ leaders had disassociated themselves from it. âIt will negate the goodwill generated by peacefully protesting farmers. I urge all genuine farmers to vacate Delhi and return to the borders,â he added. Hours earlier, in his R-Day address, Singh had lashed out at the Modi government for the farm laws, lack of consultation and sidelining of Punjab when the laws were framed. Others who voiced their worry included former minister Shashi Tharoor who said, "Most unfortunate. I have supported the farmersâ protests from the start but I cannot condone lawlessness. And on Republic Day, no flag but the sacred tiranga must fly on Red Fort." Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Gill said, "There is place for only one flag at the Red Fort and that is our tricolour, tiranga. Hoisting/putting any other flag irrespective of demands is unacceptable. We all serve the nation and nothing else is above that. People resorting to such tactics are hurting the cause of farmers." But Congress chose to remind that the provocation was the three farm laws and the procrastination on the part of the government through âendless talksâ. Party spokesman Randeep Surjewala called it an attempt to âtire outâ the farmers and said 175 farmers had died during the last 61 days of protest, but without succeeding in moving prime minister Narendra Modi into showing some sympathy.

NEW DELHI: While there was no official statement from BJP, several party leaders reacted angrily to the violent protests by farmers in the national Capital even as they maintained that the violence had showed that farm leaders had no control over their followers and that they were acting as âpuppetsâ of opposition parties. BJP leaders said the government trusted the assurance given by farmers that the tractor rally would be on specified routes, trolleys would not be taken out and that they would be unarmed. âThe protesting farmers have violated all promises they made to the government, which shows the ulterior motive of the farmers, who are working on the directions of a desperate opposition,â a senior BJP functionary said. The leader said Delhi Police had showed utmost restraint even as they were beaten otherwise things could have been far worse. âBJP has maintained right from the beginning that it is committed to the welfare of farmers. However, the way Red Fort was desecrated, the whole nation has watched it and there is nothing left to say about the hidden agenda of the farm union leaders, who are acting as per the dictation of opposition parties,â the BJP leader said. âCommon farmers should understand that the ongoing agitation is the handiwork of a few middlemen, who are fearing that the hefty money they were fleecing from farmers will come to an end,â he added. âWhile we are saluting the national flag, some elements supported by so-called âprogressivesâ are relishing insulting the same, and remember in the name of Constitution,â BJP Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Sahasrabuddhe tweeted. âCan farmers of the country do what was witnessed in Delhi today?â asked party general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya. BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi recalled sacrifices made by several icons of the country to protect and preserve freedom and sovereignty of the nation, which was attacked by a group of âshamelessâ vandals. âThose being perceived as âannadataâ have turned out to be terrorists. Donât defame our farmers and terrorists must be called terrorists,â he added. Lok Sabha MP Nishikant Dubey equated the farm leaders with Hurriyat leaders and demanded that farmers chiefs like Yogendra Yadav, Rakesh Tikait and Hannan Mollah be booked on charges of sedition.

BATHINDA: Punjabi actor-singer-activist Deep Sidhu, who farmer unions allege was responsible for taking youths towards Red Fort on Tuesday, has been making news from the beginning of the agitation since September last year. Famous for his role as a gangster in the Punjabi film âJora Das Numberiaâ in 2018, the 36-year-old was one of the first celebrities to support farmers when they took to the roads against the three laws. Before moving to the protest site at Singhu border, Deep Sidhu, who belongs to Muktsar in Punjab, had held a prolonged protest at Shambhu border between Punjab and Haryana, where accusations of Khalistani elements running the protests had been made. Actor Deep Sidhu addresses farmers at Ghazipur during their 'Delhi Chalo' protest against the Centre's farm reform laws, in New Delhi. (PTI)Farmers protest: Live updatesDuring the Lok Sabha elections in May 2019, Deep Sidhu was in the news for being close to Bollywood actor-politician Sunny Deol, who contested from Gurdaspur as a BJP candidate. Deep Sidhu was seen participating in his campaign. However, Deol distanced himself from Sidhu in a tweet, saying he or his family had no relationship with him. Raid Fort: When rampaging mob took ramparts by stormA video clip featuring Deep Sidhu raising slogans at the Red Fort has also gone viral since Tuesday afternoon. Later, in a video on his Facebook account, Deep Sidhu said when genuine rights or concerns are not addressed, anger is bound to flare up in any protest. âWe cannot accuse any individual for whatever happened. Protests as big as this are not dependent on an individual. We reached Red Fort to symbolically register our protest, to exercise our democratic right and not to challenge the unity and diversity of the country. We have put up Nishan Sahib and Kisan flag on an empty post. The Tricolour was not removed. No one should see it in a communal light. It was part of unity in diversity. Nishan Sahib symbolises the fight against injustice,â it said. Deep Sidhu &amp; government agencies behind rampage: Farm netasHe was till recently close to gangster-turned activist Lakha Sidhana who was seen trying to pacify protesting youths on Monday at Singhu border and objected to the route of the rally allowed by the police. Sidhu, who claims to be a supporter of the idea of strengthening the federal structure to give more rights to states, has long been openly quoting Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. The NIA had last month registered a case against Sikhs for Justice and had also issued notices to Sidhu and his brother Mandeep Singh. Considered close to Sikh ideologue Ajmer Singh, Sidhu practised as a lawyer before he joined the show business in 2015.

BATHINDA: Farm leaders on Tuesday evening blamed the Majha-based Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee and Deep Sidhu - who had led a group to Red Fort - for the violence in the national capital and termed the entire episode as âthe handiwork of some central agenciesâ to defame the farmersâ struggle. Sources in the Samyukt Kisan Morcha said that the foundation for the unruly scenes was laid late on Monday evening when ruckus was created at the Samyukt Morcha stage and some youngsters along with gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana had taken command of the stage from where it was openly announced that they would go on the route as planned earlier as some were talking about heading towards Red Fort. BKU-Rajewal leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said: âI had said that if we remain peaceful we will win, but if we go for violence we may not win. Now those who took farmers to wrong routes are responsible for all this. We will introspect as to why and how it all happened.â Farm leader Rajinder Singh blamed central agencies and said, âDeep Sidhu too did not play a positive role.â BKU Ekta Ugrahan president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said, âWhat happened is unfortunate and we will look into all this and see what went wrong as it seemed central agencies succeeded in making their scheme work.â BKU Haryana leader Gurnam Singh Charuni criticised Deep Sidhu for misleading youth to Red Fort and described him as a âdalal (agent)â of the Union government. He made it clear that the farmersâ agitation was not religious and it would remain the same in future. In a video released on Tuesday evening, Charuni cautioned people to beware of Deep Sidhu and said, âIt is condemnable to give it a religious colour, whatever incident has happened today at Lal Qila (Red Fort). Our andolan (protest) is of the farmers only and a mass movement, which is not at all a religious one. And whatever Deep Sidhu has done, we condemn it in strong words and we feel that he is a dalal (agent) of the government who is messing up from many days. Every time, he speaks against the farm leaders and misleads against them. Whatever he did today is highly condemnable as we had not given any such call of going to Lal Qila.â

NEW DELHI: Violence during the tractor rallies came as a setback for farm unions agitating for repeal of central farm laws. However, they expressed their determination to continue with their protests while seeking to dissociate themselves from Tuesdayâs violence. The unions said that there were no plans to abandon the march to Parliament on Budget day, though neither the courts nor the Central government may be accommodative this time. The farm unions, which have received favourable notice so far, will find themselves being closely questioned over the manner in which their rally spun out of control and resulted in chaos in Delhi on Republic Day. Red Fort raider Deep Sidhu has been quoting Jarnail Singh BhindranwaleUnion leaders do not appear ready to give up on their core demands â repeal of laws and legal guarantee to minimum support price (MSP) âand some of them feel that their protests are acquiring a larger dimension. The unions will in any case want to wait to see how opposition parties take up the stir in the Budget session, which begins on Friday. Farmers protest: Live updatesThe likely stand of the Central government, which has so far been at pains to signal its flexibility to amend the laws â short of repeal â was not clear though BJP leaders were taken aback by the violence. The government and BJP offered no word on the violence, with sources saying the priority was to restore law and order. The government seemed to expect the televised events to hurt the protest, while the proceedings in the Supreme Court, which had asked if the rally would be peaceful, could also see the Centre spelling out its stand. What is Nishan Sahib? Itâs found flying atop every gurdwaraSo far, the government has been careful in not using coercive methods, keeping in mind the sensitivity of Punjab, from where most of the unions are from, being a border state and the likely role of extremists in exploiting the situation. The unions said they had mobilised some organisations in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal to intensify the agitation. All these states, along with Assam and Manipur, witnessed protests on Tuesday. Until now, the mobilisation has been largely cadre-based with the Left-aligned All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) playing a leading role. 1/25Tractor rally: Farmers march into Delhi protesting against farm laws Previous NextShow CaptionsProtesting farmers hoist a flag from the ramparts of the Red Fort on 72nd Republic Day, in New Delhi on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: The script had been read out and the red lines drawn, but nothing went as planned when the farmers took out their tractor rally on Tuesday. A dash to the heart of Delhi on speeding tractors that rammed barricades and even threatened to mow down policemen, widespread vandalism and destruction of public property and prolonged clashes with the cops marred a two-month-long peaceful agitation on the farm laws. This was capped with the unfurling of the Sikh religious flag, Nishan Sahib, at Red Fort even as cops were battling the protesters in the foreground. The leaders who had promised a peaceful march and should have reined in the hotheads did the disappearing act and the volunteers who were supposed to keep the rally on course were not be seen anywhere. This was a pyrrhic victory, bitter harvest of what turned out to be a rudderless agitation when it came to hitting the streets. Police showed extraordinary restraint as use of force against farmers was never on the table during discussions amongst the brass. However, this strategy landed over 120 cops in the hospital, half of them with severe injuries. A few are critical and in ICU. A farmer driving a tractor dangerously crashed into barricades near ITO and died on the spot. Protestors put flags atop a dome after breaching the route during the tractor rally at Red Fort. Ignoring the schedule of 12pm to 5pm that had been agreed upon for the tractor rally, the protesters at Singhu and Ghazipur borders had begun challenging the cops as early as 6.30am. They soon began making attempts to break through the barricades. This was even before the Republic Day parade had begun. By 8am, the barricades at Singhu were down and 45 minutes later, Tikri too had been breached. The tractor rally was on, still on course. By 10am, around 6,000-7,000 tractors had entered Delhi, cocking a snook at police and violating virtually all mutually agreed terms and conditions. When this group reached Mukarba Chowk on G T Karnal Road around 10.40am, it insisted on moving towards Central Delhi, instead of going on the predesignated route. The cops tried to reason with them but the farmers, led by Nihangs on horses carrying swords and kirpans, charged at police and broke several layers of barricades between Mukarba Chowk and Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar. The protesters were teargassed and mild force used but to no avail.  A protester charges a security personnel during clashes at the Red Fort following farmers' tractor parade on Republic Day. (PTI )Meanwhile, a section of farmers at Ghazipur border smashed the barricades at several points and headed towards ITO, through Akshardham and Millennium Park, where they were joined by some farmers from Singhu. Things were getting chaotic at Tikri too. Here, a section of the protesters refused to turn towards Najafgarh and insisted on marching towards Peeragarhi and Central Delhi, leading to day-long clashes with the cops. However, it was at ITO that the protesters met with stiff resistance from the cops which turned the intersection into a battleground. The farmers turned violent and broke barricades, damaged iron railings and dividers and even tried to run over the policemen with their tractors. Around 12.35pm, the cops fired teargas shells and lathicharged the protesters, setting off a cat-and-mouse game. The protesters pelted the cops with stones. A tractor smashes its way past a barricade at Akshardham.With the arrival of reinforcements after the conclusion of the R-Day parade, police succeeded in stopping them from entering the New Delhi district and moving towards Parliament. One section of protesters then turned towards Red Fort with another staying put on Vikas Marg. Having reached the ramparts of Red Fort, the protesters hoisted the Nishan Sahib amidst much cheering even as police were being attacked in the vicinity. It was only late at night that some order could be restored and the crowd removed from the area. The clashes between police and farmers continued throughout the day. Most of the incidents were reported from Mukarba Chowk, Ghazipur, ITO, Seemapuri, Nangloi, Tikri Border and Red Fort. Delhi Police â caught between overseeing R-Day security and handling the spiralling violence â used mild force, including teargas, and suspended internet at many places. The request for the latter was made by the special cell to the home ministry which gave the order without much of an impact. According to intelligence officials, things spun out of control as the protesters were virtually leaderless. While the talks had been held with the elderly union leaders, youngsters took charge on Tuesday morning, refusing to heed any counselling or instructions by police, with the leaders having disappeared from the scene. Reacting to the day's developments, police commissioner S N Shrivastava said, "The time and the routes for the tractor rally were finalised after several rounds of meetings. But the farmers drove their tractors off the routes and before the fixed time, leading to vandalism in which many police personnel were injured." "Public property has also been damaged. I appeal to the protesting farmers not to indulge in violence, maintain peace and return through the designated routes," he added.

GHAZIABAD: Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said that some antisocial elements were behind the violence during the farmers' tractor parade in the national capital on Tuesday. It was due to the Delhi Police's âactionsâ that some anti-social elements entered the parade and caused the violence, he said. The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesman in a statement also alleged that the Delhi Police had wrongly placed barricades at some places of the pre-decided routes of the parade. "This was done intentionally to misguide farmers," Tikait said, adding that because of this, farmers on tractors went astray. This gave anti-social elements the opportunity to enter the tractor rally, he claimed. BKU believes in peaceful demonstration and will identify the miscreants behind the violence. Tikait urged protesting farmers to keep themselves away from violence. The coordination committee members of the parade will look into the reasons behind the violence, he said. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting against the Centre's new agri laws at various Delhi border points since November last year and on Tuesday, they took out tractor parades in the national capital. Ghaziabad District Information Officer (DIO) Rakesh Chauhan said in a statement that the tractor rally culminated peacefully in Ghaziabad and no untoward incident occurred. The administration had made adequate arrangements and senior police and civil officials interacted with farmer leaders every day, it said.

NEW YORK: India on Tuesday welcomed the announcement of legislative, presidential and national council elections in Palestine that will be held later this year and also urged all parties to take necessary steps to ensure free and fair elections. During the Open Debate in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on 'The Situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question', TS Tirumurti, India's Permanent Representative, lauded the peaceful efforts to "two-State solution, through direct negotiations between the two parties". He said, "India welcomes the announcement of convening legislative, presidential and national council elections later this year in Palestine and urges all parties to take necessary further steps to ensure that these elections are held fulfilling the democratic aspirations of the Palestinian people." Welcoming the normalisation of relations between Israel and some members of the League of Arab states, Tirumurti said that this will provide the "necessary momentum for the resumption of direct negotiations between Israel and Palestine." During the Open Debate, he also appreciated Egypt for helping in the process of rapprochement between the Palestinian parties, thus, "bringing them to end the internal divide". "On the broader regional developments, India welcomes the signing of the Al-Ula Declaration, which has ushered in rapprochement and reconciliation among the Gulf Corporation Council (GCC) countries. We acknowledge the key role of a unified GCC in promoting peace, stability and prosperity in the region," he added. Reiterating India's stance for a "just and comprehensive solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict", he said that India supports "President Mahmoud Abbas' call to hold an international peace conference with the participation of all relevant parties to achieve the vision of a sovereign and independent Palestine living side by side in peace and security with Israel." Speaking on the commencement of talks between Israel and Lebanon, Tirumurti said that India looks forward to the formation of the government in Lebanon as it will "offer political stability and also tackle the grave socio-economic challenges being faced by the people of Lebanon". During the Open Debate, India also emphasised on its proposal to supply vaccines to the Middle East region to help the countries combat the Covid-19 pandemic.

CHANDIGARH: The Haryana Cabinet held a special meeting here on Tuesday evening under the chairmanship of chief minister M L Khattar in the wake of the events that unfolded in the national capital during the tractor parade and appealed to all protesting farmers to return to their homes. Khattar said farmer unions had assured a peaceful tractor rally in the national capital. "But the events which unfolded today make it clear that this agitation is now not under the control of these farmer leaders. And the command of this agitation is now in the hands of such anarchic elements whose ideology is different from the farmers' interests," he said. The chief minister issued a statement asking the farmer community to ponder over where their agitation was headed. "The entire Haryana cabinet, through its special meeting held today, humbly appeals to all farmers of this agitation to return to their homes. The strong need of the hour this time is that together we defeat the designs of the anti-social elements," Khattar said. Earlier, he described as "most unfortunate" the incident of a protesting farmer hoisting a religious flag at the Red Fort. Such an incident at Red Fort on Republic Day is strongly condemnable, Khattar had said. "In a democratic setup, there is adequate space to resolve issues through dialogue," he said, referring to the farmers who have been sitting in protest for two months near Delhi's borders against the Centre's new farm laws. But no Indian will tolerate anyone hoisting any flag other than the tricolour from the ramparts of the Red Fort, Khattar said. This is an insult to those freedom fighters and martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the sake of this nation, he added. The freedom fighters did not fight for the country's independence to see the spread of this type of anarchy, Khattar said.

AKOLA: Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) leader Prakash Ambedkar on Tuesday termed the Modi government as "anti-farmer" and condemned the police action against protesters during a tractor parade taken out by cultivators in Delhi. He said it was unfortunate that such an incident took place on the Republic Day in Delhi, where violence broke out during a tractor parade taken out by farmers protesting against the Centre's new agri-marketing laws. Talking to reporters here, Ambedkar dubbed the Modi government as "anti-farmer" and said it should be more sensitive towards cultivators. "August 15 and January 26 are very important days for the country. It is wrong to charge protesters with sticks on this day. We condemn this incident. The government should be sensitive," he said. Earlier, Ambedkar flagged off a tractor rally organised in Akola city by a farm outfit in support of cultivators protesting against the Centre's new agri-marketing laws. Tens of thousands of farmers broke barriers to storm the national capital, their tractor parade to highlight their demands dissolving into unprecedented scenes of anarchy as they fought with police, overturned vehicles and delivered a national insult hoisting a religious flag from the ramparts of the Red Fort, a privilege reserved for India's tricolour. Clashes broke out in multiple places, leading to violence in well-known landmarks of Delhi and its suburbs. While there were no exact estimates of how many farmers were hurt, Delhi Police officials said 86 of their men were injured. Police baton charged farmers at Chintamani Chowk in Delhi when they broke barricades and smashed window panes of cars. The Delhi police used teargas shells to disperse the restive crowds in some places.

UNITED NATIONS: India on Tuesday said that normalisation of relations between Israel and some Arab states is an important development that has the potential to promote regional cooperation for peace and security and can provide the necessary momentum for resumption of direct negotiations between Israel and Palestine. India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti made the comments at the Security Council open debate on âThe Situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question.' "The normalisation of relations between Israel and some member states of the League of Arab states is also an important development, which has the potential to promote regional cooperation for peace, security and prosperity. Further, this can provide the necessary momentum for resumption of direct negotiations between Israel and Palestine,â he said. Former US President Donald Trump had in September last year hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and foreign ministers of the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain for the signing of the historic Abraham Accord, the first Arab-Israeli peace deal in 26 years. Until then, the only Arab nations to recognise Israel were Jordan and Egypt. In October last year, Israel and Sudan agreed to take steps to normalise relations in a diplomatic coup announced by Trump days before the 2020 US elections. In December, Morocco agreed to resume diplomatic relations with Israel under a deal brokered by the US. Tirumurti said India has always called for a just and comprehensive solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict, and has welcomed all peaceful efforts to achieve the two-State solution, through direct negotiations between the two parties. In this context, India reiterated its support for Palestine President Mahmoud Abbas' call to hold an international peace conference with the participation of all relevant parties to achieve the vision of a sovereign and independent Palestine living side by side in peace and security with Israel. He emphasised that India has committed itself and contributed to the efforts towards bringing lasting peace and stability in the region through deployment of Indian personnel as part of UN peacekeeping forces, including in United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, through substantial and timely humanitarian assistance, and through development cooperation and capacity building. âIndia proposes to supply vaccines to the region to help the countries fight the Covid-19 pandemic,â he said. On the broader regional developments, India welcomed the signing of the Al-Ula Declaration, which has ushered in rapprochement and reconciliation among the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. New Delhi acknowledges the key role of a unified GCC in promoting peace, stability and prosperity in the region, Tirumurti said. Terming the commencement of talks between Israel and Lebanon last year as a significant development, Tirumurti said India looks forward to the swift formation of the Government in Lebanon that can offer political stability and also tackle the grave socio-economic challenges being faced by the people of Lebanon. âIndia will continue to stand by Lebanon during its time of need,â he said. India welcomed the announcement of convening legislative, presidential and national council elections later this year in Palestine and urged all parties to take necessary further steps to ensure that these elections are held smoothly, fulfilling the democratic aspirations of the Palestinian people. Noting that it is heartening to see positive developments with regard to the Israel-Palestine issue, Tirumurti said India acknowledges and appreciates the efforts, inter alia, of Egypt in the process of rapprochement between the Palestinian parties, thereby bringing them together to end the internal divide. âThe resumption of civil and security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority has also begun to alleviate the situation on the ground in Palestinian territories,â he said. Tirumurti also voiced support for the efforts of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Tor Wennesland to resume the peace process, including through revitalising the Quartet, and help mediate the peace negotiations. âWe also take note of the joint efforts by Egypt, Jordan, France and Germany aimed at strengthening the collective commitment on the part of the international community to facilitate the peace process,â he said. Highlighting India's engagement with Palestine, Tirumurti said New Delhi has been consistently supporting Palestinian nation-building efforts through human resource development and institutional building. India is currently undertaking several projects in many sectors, including health, education and, technology of around $72 million. India has also supplied critical life saving drugs and medical equipment to Palestine as assistance during the Covid-19 pandemic, he said. As an incoming member of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) Advisory Committee, India underscored its commitment to continue strengthening its contribution to the Agency. New Delhi has made a multi-year enhanced annual financial contribution of five million dollars to support UNRWA's work in providing humanitarian assistance and essential services, he said.

NEW DELHI: The RSS on Tuesday condemned the violence during the farmers' tractor parade in Delhi and said the âunfortunate actâ at the Red Fort was an insult to those who sacrificed their lives for India's freedom. Deviating from the designated route for the proposed tractor parade, a section of protesting farmers entered the Red Fort and hoisted flags from some domes of the iconic monument in the national capital. The ruling BJP's ideological mentor Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) appealed to all countrymen to rise above political and ideological differences and strive for peace as a priority. âThe violence and disturbances unleashed in Delhi today, on the sacred Republic Day, are extremely painful and deplorable,â RSS general secretary Suresh Bhaiyyaji said in a statement. Joshi described the hoisting of a flag other than the national flag at the Red Fort, as an âunfortunate actâ, and said that âit is an insult to martyrs who sacrificed their lives for freedom and national integrity.â

NEW DELHI: After the instances of violent clashes between farmers and police took place in Delhi on Tuesday, the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) condemned the violence and said that those who engaged in vandalism are 'enemies' of farmers and the 'part of a conspiracy' "Those who resorted to vandalism in the capital are not farmers but they are enemies; this incident is the part of a conspiracy. We have learned a lesson from this hooliganism and will ensure in the future that no such anti-social element enters into the movement. We will run it in a peaceful manner," said All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) General Secretary Hannan Mollah. He also congratulated the farmers who took part in the rally from across the country, adding, "Such a peaceful movement did not happen in the country in last 100 years. We did not even pluck a leaf in seven months of our protest. All that happened today is a conspiracy." He condemned the violent incidents that took place during the tractor rally of the protesting farmers in the national capital. The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha also appealed to the participants to return to their respective protest venues. A total of 83 police personnel were injured on Tuesday after intense clashes with farmers, who broke police barricades and stormed into the city on Republic Day to hold a tractor rally in protest of the new farm laws. Meanwhile, a protesting farmer died after a tractor rammed into barricades and overturned at ITO, Delhi Police had earlier said.

CHANDIGARH: Haryana was put on high alert on Tuesday and mobile internet services were suspended in three districts of Sonipat, Jhajjar and Palwal until 5 pm Wednesday, the state government said, as violent farmers' protest rocked neighbouring Delhi. In the wake of the events which unfolded in the national capital, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar held a special meeting of his cabinet and appealed to all farmers to return to their homes. The need of the hour is to together defeat the designs of antisocial elements, said Khattar. He also chaired a high level meeting with senior officials including Chief Secretary Vijai Vardhan, Home Secretary Rajeev Arora and Director General of Police Manoj Yadava here in the evening to take stock of the situation. The DGP said a high alert has been sounded in the state in view of the violent incidents in several areas during the farmers' tractor parade in Delhi. He directed all district police chiefs to be extremely vigilant. Haryana Roadways bus services to Delhi were also affected in the wake of the events in the national capital, with a senior Transport Department official saying they were assessing the situation. Home Secretary Rajeev Arora said the order to suspend mobile internet services in three districts -- Palwal, Sonipat and Jhajjar â was taken to prevent any disturbance of peace and public order in the districts. The order will remain in effect till 5 pm of January 27, he said. He said the order covers internet services (2G/ 3G/4G/CDMA/GPRS), all SMS services (excluding banking and mobile recharge) and "all dongle services etc provided on mobile networks except voice calls in territorial jurisdiction of district Sonipat, Palwal and Jhajjar of Haryana State". The order was issued in view of the potential law and order situation on account of events in the national capital and to prevent any kind of spread of disinformation and rumours through various social media platforms, he said. The three Haryana districts lie adjoining the national capital. The Chief Minister later directed all Deputy Commissioners, Commissioners of Police, and Superintendents of Police to remain on 'high alert' so as to ensure the law and order situation in the state is not disturbed, an official statement said. Earlier during his Republic Day address in Panchkula, Khattar in an apparent reference to the farmers' stir against the Centre's new farm laws, said one has the freedom to agitate, but not to spread anarchy. Khattar described as âmost unfortunateâ the incident of a protesting farmer hoisting a flag at the Red Fort, Delhi. He said hoisting any flag on the Red Fort other than the tricolour was an insult to the freedom fighters and martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the sake of the nation. In a statement, DGP Yadava said all Commissioners of Police, Range ADGP/IGs and district Superintendents of Police have been asked to be on a high alert to deal strictly with rioters and miscreants. Additional force has also been deployed in sensitive areas. Besides, the intelligence wing of the police is also monitoring the entire situation, he said. The DGP warned that the police will not allow anyone to disturb law and order in the state. He also said anyone found instigating riot through any kind of rumour will be strictly dealt with as per the law. âPolice are also keeping a close eye on social media. Strict action will be taken if any kind of misleading, provocative, provoking and anarchic post is shared or forwarded on social media. People should not pay attention to the rumours and follow the Haryana Police website and Twitter handle for the latest updates," the DGP added.

NEW DELHI: Almost half of the policemen injured in the farmers' violence on Tuesday were at the Red Fort where several police personnel fell or jumped tens of feet down a wall after being pushed to the edge by a marauding mob. Protesting farmers violated the conditions pre-agreed for their tractor parade and indulged in violence and vandalism, leaving 86 police personnel injured, the Delhi Police said. As many as 41 policemen suffered injuries at the Red Fort, a senior police officer said. A video of the incident showing protestors corning the security personnel at an elevated portion of the Red Fort has gone viral on social media. #WATCH | Delhi: Protestors attacked Police at Red Fort, earlier today. #FarmersProtest https://t.co/LRut8z5KSC— ANI (@ANI) 1611674904000Policemen can be seen jumping tens of feet of wall to save themselves from unruly protestors or being pushed down by them. Authorities had also cut power to the Red Fort in order to disperse the farmers from the premises. Thousands of protesting farmers who reached ITO from the Ghazipur border clashed with police. Many of them driving tractors reached the Red Fort and entered the monument. They also hoisted flags on the domes and the flagstaff at the rampart of the national monument at which national tricolour is unfurled by the Prime Minister on Independence Day. The entire area saw chaotic scenes for hours as the protesters rampaged pelting stones and police, damaging vehicles and vandalising inside Red Fort. Police tried to control the mob using lathicharge and firing tear gas shells. In a statement, the police claimed it did all due diligence in following the conditions for the rally, but the protesters began their march much ahead of the scheduled time and extensive damage to public property was caused during the violence by them. A senior police officer said a total of 86 police personnel were injured in the clashes including 41 at the Red Fort and in the East District. He said that in the morning at Ghazipur Border, a probationer IPS officer got injured as he along with Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (East) Manjeet tried to stop the farmers from breaking the barricades. Additional DCP East Manjeet had a close shave as one of the farmers tried to hit him with his tractor but he escaped and did not sustain any injuries, the official said. The ITO resembled a war zone with a car being vandalised by angry protesters and shells, bricks and stones littering the wide streets, a testimony to the ugly turn taken by the two-month-long farmers' protests against the agri laws.

NEW DELHI: The undergraduate admissions at Delhi University will begin with the release of the first cutoff list on October 12. In a notification on the admission dates for merit- and entrance-based admissions, DU has also announced that the next academic session will begin on November 18. Admissions against each of the five cutoffs will take place in three days and continue till the beginning of the session. The university will conduct a special cutoff drive for reserved-category candidates from November 18 to 20. The entrance-based UG admissions will begin on October 19 and continue till November 13. Classes for postgraduate students will also begin on November 18, while the PG admissions will be held from October 26 to November 13. The university has been allowing applicants to edit their forms since September 12 and it will go on till October 5. In the wake of Covid-19, the admission process will be entirely online this year. Even the verification of the documents will be done remotely. So far DU has decided to release only five cutoffs, but there may be more lists to accommodate the high number of applicants. This year, with an extended period for registration, DU has got the highest-ever number of applicants at 3,53,919. TOI earlier reported that the DU administration had told the college principals that it was keen to start the process from October 12. âThe administration asked us to prepare for the admission process as it will be completely online this year,â a principal had said. So far only St Stephenâs College has released its first list on September 16, with 99.25% being the highest cutoff for economics (honours) for Class XII commerce students. The high percentage has prompted many principals to opine that initial cutoffs will be higher than usual this year.

NEW DELHI: During the pandemic, all roads for candidates seeking postponement of examinations leads to the Supreme Court, which on Thursday scheduled hearing on a PIL seeking deferment of Civil Services (Prelim) examination to be held on October 4. The SC has already dealt with similar pleas seeking postponement of various examinations â National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (UG), JEE (Main), final year college, CBSE board and chartered accountants â in the past few months. In all cases, the SC had satisfied itself about safety measures taken to minimise spread of Covid-19 infection among candidates and had allowed the examinations to go on. In case of final year examinations, states had said they would not conduct tests and declare candidates passed based on their past performance. But the University Grants Commission said it would not recognise degrees given to students without appearing in final examinations. A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan had said the UGC was the final authority on conduct of exams and, hence, states could not say they would award degrees to students without final year examinations. However, it had said that states, under the Disaster Management Act, had the power to postpone final year examinations beyond the September 30 deadline set by UGC owing to the health emergency. However, another bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra had refused to intervene in conduct of NEET (UG) and JEE (Main) examinations but saw to it that the authorities ensured proper safeguards. The SC had said the pandemic was a reality but life must go on. Six states had come together to file a petition seeking review of the order and sought a stay on these two exams but the SC had summarily dismissed the review plea. The bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna too has dealt with the issue relating to postponement of chartered accountants examination and refused relief. The same bench on Thursday dealt with the petition filed by V G Sai Prakash seeking postponement of UPSC (Prelim) examination. The bench asked the petitioner to serve an advance copy of the petition to the UPSC counsel as well as the standing counsel for the Union government and posted the matter for hearing on September 28. The petitioner has sought quashing of the examination scheduled for October 4 citing difficulties posed by the pandemic and natural calamities.

MUMBAI: IIT aspirants from across the world will fly into India to take the JEE (Advanced) 2020 on September 27. Ever since the IITs stepped out of the country to conduct their entrance exam in 2008, this is the first time that they will not be travelling out to hold JEE, hamstrung by the Covid pandemic. But that has not hampered the plans of aspirants. As many as 89 foreigners, as well as candidates holding Overseas Citizen of India cards and persons of Indian origin, have registered to take JEE(A) here. While foreign students directly take JEE (A), Indians from across the world have to take JEE (Main) to qualify. This year, JEE (M) was held in September. âAs our faculty could not fly outside India, we expressed our inability to conduct JEE (A) in foreign countries. But students have paid fees to take the exam here. So, they will come to India,â JEE (A) organising chairman Siddharth Pandey said. IITs reserve 10% supernumerary seats for foreign students. At present, the 23 IITs have a total of 12,461 seats. Outside of India, JEE (A) is usually held in Kathmandu in Nepal, Singapore, Dhaka in Bangladesh, Dubai in UAE, Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, and Colombo in Sri Lanka. Not this year, though. Last year, 807 foreigners had registered for JEE (A), but merely 53 took both the papers and only one qualified. Meanwhile, more than 1.6 lakh candidates from India of the 2.5 lakh who had qualified after JEE (M) have registered for JEE (A). âFor these candidates, we were able to allocate a city among the eight preferences that they provided in their registration forms. We did the best considering the pandemic and the scale of operation,â said IIT-Delhi director Ramgopal Rao. âNearly 1.3 lakh candidates (or 85.4%) have been allocated the first choice of the city they had opted for, while 97.9% of candidates got an exam city among their top three choices.â In 2019, of the 2.5 lakh eligible candidates from JEE (M), 1.7 lakh had registered for JEE (A). All physically challenged candidates, irrespective of whether they paid their exam fees or not, were allocated their first choice of exam centre. âLast year, JEE (A) was conducted across 600 centres in India; this year, the centre count is 1,000,â said Pandey. Of the 5,320 candidates who have not yet paid their exam fee, 40.5% were allocated an exam centre which was their first choice. âThese are students who have completed their registration partly but have not paid their fees. Therefore, they were given the least preference. This is with the assumption that they are unlikely to attend the exam. They will have to pay the fee at the centre to be able to take the exam,â Rao said.

The University of Delhi (DU) has been conducting open book exams (OBE) for final year undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) students. A total of 2,53,677 final year undergraduate and postgraduate students were to appear in the OBE exams this year, of which, 2,12,256 have appeared in the first phase of OBE exams. However, of around 40,000 remaining students, only 12,000 have registered for the second phase, where around 10,000 have still opted for online mode and only 3000 will appear for offline exams. Balaram Pani, dean of colleges, DU, says that a higher number of students opting for online exams shows that studentsâ have accepted the mode. âInitially, students wanted the exams to be rescheduled, but the current situation is familiar to everyone. Students have realised that the pandemic is not just for a few months. They do not want to waste a year or miss out on opportunities.â In Ramjas College, only three of the 34 registered students will appear physically. Similarly, in Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College (ARSD) college only eight students will appear for offline exams. However, there is no clarity regarding more than 25000 students who have not yet registered to appear for the exams. Pani says that a set number of students do not appear for exams each year. âOften, students of distance education do not appear for final year exams due to various reasons. This year, the number is slightly higher than the previous years. But, students not appearing for final exams is a yearly pattern,â he adds. Former director of DUâs School of Open Learning, CS Dubey, says that lesser students are opting for offline exams because of the coronavirus scare. âWhile students have gradually become comfortable with the online mode, which is fairly easy for them to attempt, the challenge lies with the evaluators. The teachers are not yet ready for the evaluation process of online exams. Lesser students are opting for offline exams as they are scared of coronavirus and are utilising the available options,â adds Dubey. As per the universityâs statement, a total of 5,42,643 papers were attempted by regular, Non-Collegiate Womenâs Education Board (NCWEB) and School of Open Learning (SoL) students in the during the first week (August 10-17) of open-book exams of which 4,54,212 answer scripts were received.

NEW DELHI: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Thursday informed the Supreme Court that it will declare the compartment results for Class 12 students on or before October 10. Even as the counsel for University Grants Commission (UGC) submitted before a bench comprising Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna that as per its academic calender the admissions will close by October 31. The bench recorded the submissions of the counsel. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court had asked the CBSE to declare results of compartment exams of around 2 lakh students as soon as possible, so that they could apply in colleges by the cut-off date. The bench had urged the CBSE and the UGC to devise an arrangement on the issue and work in tandem so that the future of stidents were not put at stake. The observation from the top court came on a plea seeking extension of college admission deadlines in the backdrop of delayed compartment exams. Senior advocate Vivek Tankha, representing petitioners, had submitted before the bench that the compartment exams will begin on Tuesday and end on September 29, and if the college admissions were over before the results were announced then the students would lose out on the opportunity for the current academic year. The bench asked the UGC that this being a peculiar situation, could it explore making some room for students taking the compartment exam. "Academic career of 2 lakh students cannot be hampered. If the CBSE declares results by end of October, then you can wrap up admissions by first week of November," the bench had noted. The counsel appearing for the UGC submitted that the academic calendar has been finalized and the admissions would conclude by the end of October. The bench asked the UGC to hold the academic calendar till September 24. "Let CBSE inform us and then you both coordinate. Two lakh students -- is not a small number... You need to work in tandem with CBSE," the bench told the UGC counsel. The CBSE counsel contended before the bench that the compartment papers would have to be checked in 16 regional centres, therefore it could take nearly 4 weeks to declare the results.

Hospitals and health centres across several cities and towns in many states and UTs could not achieve their Covid-19 vaccination targets on Tuesday thanks to continuing hesitancy among health workers in taking the shot, with a section of doctors in hospitals in Hyderabad even writing letters to their superiors, saying they would rather wait for more options before they take a jab. Reports of several cases of adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) were among the factors which caused health workers to skip the inoculations despite their names listed at the centres. âThereâre cases of adverse effects being reported for the available vaccines and one is still under trial,â read a letter by a senior resident at Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (TIMS) in Hyderabad, referring to Covaxin. âI prefer to wait until there is a better vaccine available,â the doctor said in the letter. As many as 67 health workers at TIMS refused to take the jab on Tuesday. âIf I take the vaccine now, I will not be able to take another vaccine in the near future, which might have better efficacy,â wrote a senior doctor from Osmania General Hospital, where less than 200 out of the 600 beneficiaries listed took the vaccine Scores of health workers skipped inoculation in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad in Maharashtra because of hesitancy. The deputy director for health services, Sanjay Deshmukh, said the refusals were due to anxiety over safety and efficacy of the vaccines. In Nagpurâs Government Medical College and Hospital, the exclusive centre for Covaxin in the city, only 29 out of 100 beneficiaries took the jab on Tuesday.

OSLO/ NORWAY: Twenty-three people died in Norway within days of receiving their first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine with 13 of those deaths apparently related to the side effects of the shots, New York Post reported citing the health officials. All 13 were nursing home patients and at least 80 years old. Common reactions to the vaccine, including fever and nausea, "may have contributed to a fatal outcome in some frail patients," New York Post quoted Sigurd Hortemo, chief physician at the Norwegian Medicines Agency, as saying in a statement on Friday. While officials aren't expressing serious concern, they are adjusting their guidance on who should receive the vaccine. More than 30,000 people in Norway have received the first shot of the Pfizer or Moderna coronavirus vaccine since late last month. Agency's medical director Steinar Madsen has stated that the "agency is not alarmed by this." "It is quite clear that these vaccines have very little risk, with a small exception for the frailest patients. Doctors must now carefully consider who should be vaccinated. Those who are very frail and at the very end of life can be vaccinated after an individual assessment," he said. The agency reported Thursday that a total of 29 people had suffered side effects, including the 13 people who died. Twenty-one women and eight men experienced side effects, officials said. Besides those who died, nine had serious side effects -- including allergic reactions, strong discomfort and severe fever -- while seven had less serious ones, including severe pain at the injection site, New York Post reported. According to health officials around 400 people die each week in the nursing home population. A Pfizer rep said the company is "aware of reported deaths" following the administration of the vaccine in Norway and is working with the Norwegian Medicines Agency to gather all the relevant information. The total number of coronavirus cases reported in Norway is 58,202, while the death toll stands at 517, according to the Johns Hopkins University

PATNA: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday indirectly hinted that he might get removed midway like Karpoori Thakur because he has been working for the welfare and progress of all sections of the society just like the veteran socialist leader. âKarpoori Thakur Ji, as the CM, worked for the welfare of all sections of the society but he was removed from the post within two years. We too are working in the interest of all sections of society. Sometimes, some people get annoyed because of working in the interest of all sections of the society,â Nitish said while addressing an event organised at the JD(U) office to commemorate Jannayak Karpoori Thakur on his birth anniversary. Born in a very poor family of barbers, Thakur rose to the post of Bihar CM twice. First time, he took oath as the CM on December 22, 1970 but had to quit the post on June 2, 1971 within a period of six months. He became the CM for the second time on June 24, 1977 but again he was compelled to quit the post April 21, 1979 before completion of even two years in the office. Nitish was referring to Thakurâs second term as the CM. Recalling how he has been observing the birth anniversary of Jannayak Karpoori Ji ever since he became the MLA for the first time, Nitish also said he had been trying his best to implement the thoughts of Thakur. The event was organized by the JD(U)âs Extremely Backward Classes (EBC) cell at âKapoori Bhawanâ in the JD(U) office in Patna. The CM also said his party- JD(U) and its workers were marching ahead after adopting the ideals of great leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, Ram Manohar Lohia, Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan and Karpoori Thakur. "We did work for the development of all regions of the state and people of all strata of the society by working on the principle of âDevelopment with Justice.â Whatever policies we framed, they benefited all sections of the society,â Nitish said. "Since the first day of my coming into power in November 2005, several schemes were implemented to ensure progress of the people belonging to the SC, ST, minorities, extremely backward classes and women. Some special initiatives were taken to bring the people living on the margins, in the mainstream of the society. Women were provided 50% reservation in the panchayati raj institutions to provide them adequate representation at the grassroots level,â Nitish said while recalling how his government since 2005 did so many works to ensure progress of all sections of the society. Reminding the people about the bad governance of Lalu-Rabri regime, Nitish said every senior person in the state knew as to what was the situation during the previous regime. âWhat was the situation earlier? People did not used to come out of their home after the sunset. What was the condition of roads in those days?â Nitish quipped and asked the party men to inform the new generation about the dark days of the previous governments in Bihar. On this occasion, the JD(U) also decided to name its all district and block level offices after Karpoori Thakur. âHenceforth, all JD(U) offices at the district and block level will be known as âKarpoori Bhawanâ,â the partyâs state general secretary Navin Kumar Arya said. The JD(U) national president RCP Singh and many senior party leaders also addressed the event.

BENGALURU: With the government staying mum on a decision to reopen primary classes, educationists and stakeholders are beginning to up the ante, seeking immediate action on the issue. âVidyarthigala Nade Shaleya Kadeâ, a group comprising stakeholders, educationists and health experts that has been seeking reopening of schools for months now, has already chalked out their next course of action â to leave children on school campuses from February 1. The group has been vociferous on the issue and had earlier put pressure on the government by shooting videos of schoolchildren demanding reopening of schools in December. The government then allowed campuses to reopen for classes 10 and 12 from January 1, while on-campus Vidyagama sessions for classes 6-9 also began the same day. At that time, the government had said it will decide on throwing open campuses for other classes after 15 days, depending on the situation. VP Niranjanaradhya, Centre for Child and Law, NLSIU, who is batting for schools to reopen, said about the campaign: âWe had initially planned to start the new campaign on Monday (January 25), but have decided to wait till February 1. As per the campaign, parents will leave their children on campus when they leave for work as they believe itâs the safest place for their children. School development monitoring committees have requested the cooperation of teachers to look after children.â He went on to say, âUnlike older children, primary school graders will not be able to manage lessons by themselves. They need guidance from teachers. When the Supreme Court has said even anganwadis can open, why is the government still hesitating on opening schools?â Moydeen Kutty, president, School Development Monitoring Committee Coordination Forum, said: âChildren, and their parents, have been sitting at home for almost a year now with no learning happening. Parents are unable to go to work as they have no place to send their children. Those homes where parents used to go to work leaving the younger child in the care of an older sibling are also in a dilemma now as older children are back in school.â The worry is also about providing midday meals. Dr Srinivas Kakkilaya, physician and activist, said: âWorld over, schools have reopened and classes for grades 10 and 12 have begun here too. Have Covid-19 cases increased after schools reopened? It has been proved time and again that children between 3 and 10 years of age are the least affected by Covid-19. For young children, school is not just about academics; it is also about learning social skills. Inadequate nutrition has also been a major concern. Itâs time the government provides straight answers.â The department of public instruction has said it has already recommended to the government to resume oncampus classes for grades 9 and 11. âItâs up to the government now. Reopening classes 6 to 8 have been discussed orally. However, we are moving cautiously on reopening for primary grades,â said V Anbukkumar, commissioner.

SURAT: His heart ailment, diabetes and other diseases donât give this 63-year-old farmer sleepless nights. Itâs the sheer agony of his sixth wife, 21 years younger to him, refusing to share bed that causes him all the heartache. When people were desperately seeking some panacea for coronavirus in September last year, Ayyub Degiya was determinedly hunting for a seventh wife, after almost five months into his sixth but unconsummated marriage. Degiya, a wealthy farmer from Kapletha village in Surat district, got married for the sixth time in September 2020 and separated in December after the younger woman allegedly refrained from keeping a physical relationship with him. âShe did not allow me to sleep with her. She used to complain of infection. I have heart disease, diabetes and other diseases. I need a wife who can keep a relationship with me,â Degiya told TOI. Degiyaâs first wife is alive and lives in the same village with their five children, aged between 20 and 35 years. The 42-year-old Rander woman, a widow, did a background check on Degiya and was shocked to discover that she was biwi no. 6. Last week, she lodged a complaint against him in Mahila police station. The accused has been booked under IPC section 498-A (cruelty to married woman). âHe got married to more than five women before marrying me but kept me in the dark. After deserting me, he is now living with another woman even when his first wife is alive. I was told by some villagers that he keeps relations for a few months with women and later abandons them,â the complainant told TOI. Chandresh Jobanputra, her lawyer, added, âIn December, Degiya dropped the woman at her sister's house in Rander saying he was going out of town. He assured to pick her up upon return. But he never came back and hence she approached the police.â Jobanputra said Degiya initially approached her family claiming that he wants to marry and support the woman as she is a widow. He said it was permissible under their faith. He promised to give her Rs two lakh worth jewellery and a house, a promise which he allegedly reneged upon. Degiya, however, could not give a satisfactory reply when asked why he separated from all his previous wives. Asmita Pargi, investigation officer at Mahila police station said, âDegiya told us that he does not wish to live with the woman as she is unfit to fulfil his physical demands. Further action will be taken after registering statements of all those concerned.

MUMBAI: In an unusual instance, a 53-year-old woman from Goregaon has been booked for insulting the modesty of her 36-year-old neighbour. The accused allegedly taunted the victim repeatedly for her short hair, clothes and called her a âeunuchâ. The victim, a general manager with a private company, had moved as a tenant to the apartment complex in December 2020. An FIR was registered against the accused woman, a tiffin supplier, on Saturday under IPC sections 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and 500 (defamation). âMy client was subjected to gross harassment at the instance of her neighbour, a woman, by uttering words and exhibiting gestures of extremely derogatory nature that would amount to outraging and tarnishing modesty of any woman only because sheâs a single woman living as a tenant independently and has a âbob cutâ. The matter is currently under investigation,â the victimâs lawyer Siddhesh Borkar said. In her statement to the police, the victim said that for the first few days after she moved into the building, she had availed tiffin service from the accused. However, since she did not like the food, she stopped the service and settled her dues. The woman said on December 12 when the accused was not home, her son hosted a party. âThe music was being loudly played till 3.30 am, so I went to the door twice and requested them to turn down the volume. After that I stopped interacting and talking to the family,â the victim said. She alleged the accused, in retaliation, started taunting her for her short hair. The victim alleged she would stand outside her house and make comments to humiliate her such as âI donât know if she is a psycho, a girl or a boy? Her voice is like that of a dog.â She even went to the extent of slut-shaming her. The victim said this went on for a month, but she ignored her. The matter escalated on January 11 when the victim was visiting another neighbour. She said the accused first commented on her trousers and loudly questioned if she had soiled it by wetting herself. The accused even followed her to her friendâs house and started abusing her loudly. The victim alleged she called her names such âprostituteâ and âslutâ, questioned her gender and even abused her parents. She accused her of inviting and soliciting men at the house. The accused told her she was a tenant and should live like one. The victim said she then contacted a policeman who lived in the building. He advised her to call up the 100 police helpline. With the harassment allegedly continuing even after that, the victim finally lodged an FIR.

LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday held the BJP-led central government responsible for turning farmers' "resentment into anger" and demanded immediate withdrawal of new agri laws. His remarks come after clashes broke out at multiple places during the farmers' tractor parade in Delhi on Tuesday. Tens of thousands of protesters broke through barriers, fought with police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the iconic Red Fort. "The way the BJP government has continuously neglected, humiliated and accused the farmers, it played a decisive role in turning the resentment of the farmers into anger. Only the BJP is responsible for the present situation," Yadav said in a tweet in Hindi. He said the government should immediately withdraw the farm laws considering it as its moral responsibility.

UNITED NATIONS: India has announced a pledge of $150,000 to activities of the Peacebuilding Fund this year and said that 2021 provides the international community with an opportunity to look at peacebuilding in a more focused manner, especially in the context of the Covid pandemic. âWhile I would like to assure you all of our sincere commitment to remain engaged in peacebuilding, we extend our support to the activities of the Peacebuilding Fund and as a token of our engagement, India would like to announce today a pledge of $150,000 to the fund's activities and programme this year,â India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti said. In a virtual address to the High-Level Replenishment Conference for the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund Tuesday, he said India believes that 2021 provides the international community with an opportunity to look at peacebuilding in the broader context and in a more focused manner, especially in the context of the Covid pandemic, which is threatening to erode the gains made over the years. He added that the recently concluded 2020 review of the UN peacebuilding architecture provides a framework to strengthen peace building collectively. He voiced appreciation that as a part of its 2020-24 strategy, the Peacebuilding Fund has put forth a comprehensive scenario covering a horizon of five years. The Fund requires 1.5 billion dollars for 2020-2024. âThere is no doubt that conflict prevention is essential to ensure that peacekeeping translates into something more durable for the benefit of the people,â he said, adding that for this determined support is needed from member states to strengthen the hands of the United Nations. He emphasised that strengthening security structures go hand in hand with strengthening civilian structures of good governance. âWe need to consequently prioritise our focus on specific aspects of peacebuilding, which will have the highest impact in post-conflict situations, so that the funds are utilised to the optimum.â UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said at the conference that peacebuilding in fragile contexts requires political courage and leadership at national and local levels, but also the right support at the right time from the international community. âWe need to take risks for peace and enable stakeholders with the resources and space to seize opportunities. We have a responsibility to bring down the institutional silos and bring together, in an agile and responsive manner, the full range of the UN system capacities,â he said. The UN chief pointed out that as the medium-term effects of the COVID19 pandemic become more apparent, it is more important than ever to ensure the fund is adequately and predictably resourced. In 2020, the Peacebuilding Fund mobilised over $180 million, which Guterres said is an important sign of the trust the fund has garnered over the years and its demonstrated ability to deliver in the most difficult contexts. "But its resources are now depleted. We must urgently replenish it. Doing so will save lives and serve as a clear demonstration of multilateral support.â Tirumurti highlighted India's constructive and significant role in the context of peacebuilding through its extensive development partnership in developing countries, particularly in Africa and Asia. India continues to assist countries bilaterally in post-conflict situations by providing substantial grants and soft loans, apart from focusing on infrastructure, especially housing, education and health, on connectivity, providing livelihood to those impacted by conflict, especially in agriculture and on projects at the grassroots level. He cited the example from Afghanistan, where India has undertaken projects in every province of the country. India has tried to enhance the security environment of these countries since peace, security and development have to go together. India is also fulfilling its commitment to make available its Covid-19 vaccines to other countries and has already supplied more than six million doses to nine countries in phase one as grant assistance. The Peacebuilding Fund is the UN's financial instrument of first resort to sustain peace in countries or situations at risk or affected by violent conflict. The Fund's 2020-2024 strategy is its most ambitious yet, responding to the Secretary-General's call for a quantum leap of support for peacebuilding and prevention. The Fund has invested over $1.2 billion to date in over 60 countries, with support from almost 60 member states. At the close of the conference, the co-chairs issued a Joint Communique stating that the General Assembly would convene a High-Level meeting on financing peace during its 76th session. "The Conference took place at a time of unprecedented challenges and as the world contends with the tragic immediate effects of the pandemic and its alarming medium to long-term impacts. The unprecedented economic shocks and inadequate response strategies are entrenching social and economic inequalities and increasing risks for crisis, eroding peace and development gains along the way," the Joint Communique said. Member states reiterated the importance of investing in peace. Including funds received for 2020, a total of 39 member states have contributed or pledged over $439 million for peacebuilding in support of the Fund's 2020-2024 Strategy which set a target of $1.5 billion.

NEW DELHI: Twitter on Wednesday said it suspended more than 300 accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation as the farmers' tractor rally went violent in the national capital on the 72nd Republic Day. The farmers swarmed the Red Fort and waved farmer union flags from its ramparts. They even hoisted farmer union flags as well as a pennant with a Sikh religious symbol from a flagpole. A Twitter spokesperson told IANS that the company has taken strong enforcement action to protect the conversation on the service from attempts to incite violence, abuse and threats that could trigger the risk of offline harm by blocking certain terms that violate our rules for trends. "Using a combination of technology and human review, Twitter worked at scale and took action on hundreds of Tweets that have been in violation of the Twitter Rules and suspended more than 300 accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation," the spokesperson informed. The Delhi Police on Sunday had warned that 308 Twitter handles have been generated to create confusion over the tractor rally proposed by protesting farmers on Republic Day. "Through intelligence and various other agencies, we have continuously been getting inputs regarding a threat to create disturbance in the tractor rally. Nearly 308 Twitter handles have been generated from Pakistan to create confusion," said Dependra Pathak, Special Commissioner Police, Intelligence, Delhi Police.

This is why we want Senate polls to be held through an open ballot,â Information Minister Shibli Faraz told the media after the meeting. He said that in the past, money was used in Senate elections and votes were bought making the House election a mockery. He asked what was the use of an upper house in which people come through purchasing of votes. Faraz also said that people opposing the proposed move are forgetting that their own party had demanded open ballot in the past. âThe government will present a constitutional amendment bill in the parliament so that Senate polls are held through open ballot,â he said. Already the government petitioned to the Supreme Court, seeking direction to hold the upcoming Senate elections through open ballot. The decision is pending. Meanwhile, Dawn newspaper quoted a Cabinet member as saying that Prime Minister Khan tasked his advisor parliamentary affairs Babar Awan to table a bill in the National Assembly for holding Senate elections through open ballot when the adviser was giving a briefing on the status of the government's reference in the Supreme Court. Awan said the government had already laid two bills â Constitution Amendment Bill and Electoral Reforms Bill â in Parliament on the basis of which desired legislation could be done for an open ballot. The Cabinet member said Awan had called a meeting of his ministry and its legislation branch to devise a roadmap on how to proceed with the matter in Parliament. It has been proposed that since Senate polls could not be held through show of hand because every voter has to show his preference in the ballot paper. Therefore, to ensure open identity of the voter, the voter should be required to mention his name on the back side of the ballot paper, according to Dawn newspaper. Senate elections will be held in the first half of next month and prime minister Khan's ruling Pakistan Tehreek-I-Insaf is wary that its own members may vote a gay party policy, according to Opposition parties that are against the move.

TOKYO: Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga apologised on Wednesday after lawmakers from his ruling coalition visited night clubs despite his government's call for people to avoid unnecessary outings to curb the spread of Covid-19. The news is another headache for Suga whose approval rating has tumbled due to dissatisfaction with his handling of the pandemic, which critics have called too slow and inconsistent. "I'm terribly sorry that this happened when we are asking people not to eat out after 8pm and to avoid non-essential, non-urgent outings," Suga told parliament. "Each lawmaker should behave to gain the public's understanding." Japan this month issued a state of emergency in Tokyo and other areas to tame a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases. The measure includes a request for restaurants and bars to close by 8pm although there are currently no penalties for non-compliance. "My behaviour was careless at a time when we are asking people to be patient," Jun Matsumoto, a senior lawmaker from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, told reporters. Matsumoto was speaking following a Daily Shincho magazine report that he had visited two night clubs in Tokyo's posh Ginza district after dining at an Italian restaurant last Monday. Kiyohiko Toyama, a lawmaker from the coalition's junior partner Komeito, also apologised after tabloid Shukan Bunshun reported he had visited a high-end night club in Ginza until late last Friday. Twitter users voiced their frustration. "It is just a matter of time before public anger explodes. I don't want a blanket cash-payout of 100,000 yen ($965), I want them to quit! " wrote one user. "They are really stupid. Don't they think about what they are doing and how the public sees them? If they don't, they are unqualified to represent the public," said another.

NEW YORK: A US bankruptcy judge has approved a $17 million payout to dozens of women who accused jailed movie producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual abuse. Weinstein, 68, was sentenced to 23 years in prison last year after being convicted of rape and sexual assault. Delaware Judge Mary Walrath on Monday agreed to the Weinstein Company's liquidation plan, which sets aside the payment. She overruled the objections of several of Weinstein's victims who complained that the settlement prevented them from pursuing other legal claims. The money will be split between 37 women, meaning they are each likely to receive six-figure sums. Lawyers representing some victims had earlier denounced the proposed settlement as insufficient. Eight accusers who rejected the settlement will be able to sue the ex-Hollywood mogul later. Weinstein was found guilty in February 2020 of a criminal sexual act in the first degree and rape in the third degree in a landmark verdict for the #MeToo movement. His sentence capped a remarkable downfall for the "Pulp Fiction" producer who was accused of years of vile predatory behavior by almost 90 women, including Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek. The Weinstein Company declared bankruptcy in March 2018 after the avalanche of claims. Lantern Capital, later renamed Spyglass Media Group, bought its assets for $289 million. Weinstein is also awaiting trial in Los Angeles on rape and sexual assault charges involving five women.

NEW DELHI: China's ByteDance is cutting the size of its 2,000-plus India team and is unsure when it will make a comeback, the company told employees in an internal memo on Wednesday, months after its popular TikTok video app was banned. The move came after India this month decided to retain its ban on TikTok and 58 other Chinese apps following responses from the companies on issues such as compliance and privacy. TikTok, WeChat, Baidu and UC Browser among 59 Chinese apps permanently banned in IndiaThe ban dates from last year when political tension between the neighbours rose over their disputed border. "We initially hoped that this situation would be short-lived ... we find that has not been the case," ByteDance wrote in the memo which was seen by Reuters. "We simply cannot responsibly stay fully staffed while our apps remain un-operational ... we don't know when we will make a comeback in India" In a statement, the company said it was disappointing that despite its efforts it had not received a clear direction on how and when its apps could be reinstated. It did not specify how many employees would lose their jobs. Before the ban, India had been one of TikTok's largest markets and ByteDance in 2019 had laid out plans to invest $1 billion in India. At the time of last year's ban, the Indian government described the apps as prejudicial to the "sovereignty and integrity of India". The move followed a skirmish with Chinese troops. In the United States, the previous Trump administration ordered ByteDance to divest TikTok citing national security concerns, and sought to impose restrictions that would have effectively barred its use. TikTok has also come under scrutiny in Australia for any risks it may pose to users from around potential foreign interference and data privacy issues.

SAN FRANCISCO: A spat erupted Tuesday between Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk as the tech titans' space firms exchanged barbs over their rival satellite internet projects being evaluated by regulators. Amazon, founded and led by Bezos, put out a statement claiming Musk's rival SpaceX project Starlink was seeking design changes that could "create a more dangerous environment for collisions in space" and also increase radio interference. "Despite what SpaceX posts on Twitter, it is SpaceX's proposed changes that would hamstring competition among satellite systems," Amazon said in a statement, outlining its objections to regulators. "It is clearly in SpaceX's interest to smother competition in the cradle if they can, but it is certainly not in the public's interest." Musk meanwhile fired off his own objection to Amazon's complaint, claiming that his plan is moving faster than his rival's. "It does not serve the public to hamstring Starlink today for an Amazon satellite system that is at best several years away from operation," Musk tweeted. @thesheetztweetz It does not serve the public to hamstring Starlink today for an Amazon satellite system that is atâ¦ https://t.co/sNiGKxdXFP— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) 1611658035000Musk, who is also the founder of Tesla and recently overtook Bezos as the world's richest person, is in a race against Amazon's $10 billion Project Kuiper space-based internet delivery system, which has won US regulatory approval to deploy more than 3,000 low-orbit satellites. SpaceX has been deploying small satellites to form a global broadband system and is lobbying regulators for permission to move them into lower orbits, which has prompted Amazon's concerns. SpaceX argued in a letter to the Federal Communications Commission that the orbit modifications being sought would not increase chances of interfering with rival satellites. It contended that any claims of such interference were "misleading," and that Amazon was trying to "stifle competition." SpaceX on Sunday launched its Falcon 9 rocket carrying a record number of satellites on board. Scientists have expressed concerns about the number of objects clogging the space around Earth. SpaceX say their satellites are designed to burn up in the atmosphere within a few years. Project Kuiper aims to deliver satellite-based broadband services in the United States, and eventually around the world, and may offer connectivity for wireless carriers and 5G networks.

NEW DELHI: With International Monetary Fund (IMF) projecting that India will reclaim the status of world's fastest-growing economy and projected its growth at 11.5 per cent in 2021, experts on Wednesday said that India is rebounding to achieve the target of a $5 trillion economy. Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal termed the IMF projections for India as "Bright star in the global economy." "Bright Star in Global Economy: India to continue its growth story at rapid pace under PM @NarendraModi ji, with @IMFNews projecting an impressive 11.5% growth rate for India in 2021. It makes India only major economy to register double-digit growth in 2021," Goyal tweeted. Charan Singh, CEO, EGROW Foundation and former RBI chair professor said, "As was expected, and I had been arguing that India's fundamentals are strong, IMF, in its latest release has projected India's growth at 11.5 per cent in 2021 and 6.8 per cent in 2022. This is the highest growth rate to be recorded by any country." Singh said that IMF observed that the substantial revision in India's growth projection is because of stronger than expected recovery after lockdown. "Hence, India has saved the lives of people in lockdown, and now galloping to recoup growth trajectory. This has been due to the well-calibrated, adequately sequenced policies of the Government. Thus, a V-shaped recovery is on the way, and India is rebounding, to achieve a $5 Trillion Economy, despite the Covid set-back," he added. DK Mishra, a market expert, said that Covid-19 pandemic has impacted worldwide economies in a big way but Indian economy has come out of initial hits due to measures taken by government and strong consumer demands. "The same is evident from strong GST collections and good agricultural growth. The projection for 11.50 per cent growth by IMF in GDP is yet another confirmation of the strong recovery of the economy. The future outlook with the Covid vaccine in the market will be good for our economy," he said. In its latest World Economic Outlook update released on Tuesday, the IMF predicted that India's gross domestic product (GDP) will grow at the pace of 11.5 per cent in 2021. IMF projections show that India's economy will grow much better than China which is predicted to grow at 8.1 per cent, followed by Spain (5.9 per cent), France (5.5 per cent) and United States (5.1 per cent).

WASHINGTON: An Indian national has pleaded guilty to conspiracy and identity theft in connection with an overseas robocall scam that defrauded thousands in the US, mostly elderly people, of nearly $8 million, the Department of Justice said. Shehzadkhan Pathan, 39, operated a call centre in Gujarat's Ahmedabad that placed automated robocalls to victims in the United States, as per court documents. After establishing contact with the victims through these automated calls, Pathan and other "closers" at his call centre would coerce, cajole, and trick victims to send bulk cash through physical shipments and electronic money transfers, federal prosecutors alleged. Pathan and his conspirators used a variety of schemes to convince victims to send money, including impersonating law enforcement officers from the FBI and DEA and representatives of other government agencies such as the Social Security Administration, to threaten victims with severe legal and financial consequences. Conspirators also convinced the victims to send money as initial installments for falsely promised loans, the court documents said. According to the court papers, Pathan also recruited and supervised several money mules, who he directed to receive money sent by the victims. His network of money mules was located in multiple states, including but not limited to Virginia, New Jersey, Minnesota, Texas, California, South Carolina, and Illinois. Pathan assigned various aliases to these individuals and supplied them with hundreds of counterfeit identification documents to facilitate their receipt of cash shipments and money transfers. He then directed the money mules to send the money to himself and other conspirators through various means, including cash deposits into numerous bank accounts and via informal money transmitters known as hawalas, the prosecutors alleged. The Department of Justice said Pathan's scams disproportionately targeted elderly victims, many of whom suffered substantial financial hardship. In total, Pathan is responsible for defrauding over 5,000 US victims of at least $8 million, it added. His sentencing is scheduled for May 14. Pathan faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for the conspiracy, along with a mandatory consecutive term of two years for aggravated identity theft.

WASHINGTON: Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna on Saturday hoped for a peaceful and fair solution to the farmers' issues in India, saying he is encouraged by the ongoing dialogue between the protesting farmers and the government. Khanna, 44, was recently elected for a third consecutive term from the congressional district representing Silicon Valley. âIndia and the US share a rich tradition of democracy and peaceful protests. Farmworkers are the backbone of both our nations and must have their voices heard. I hope there's a peaceful and fair solution so they can provide for their families,â Khanna said in a tweet on Saturday. âI am encouraged by the ongoing dialogue,â he said, joining other American lawmakers who have expressed their views on the ongoing farmers' protest in India, several of whom have expressed their concerns. âAs Co-Chair of the American Sikh Caucus in Congress, my office has received first-hand accounts of the horrific crackdowns on protestors who are trying to peacefully express their disapproval of India's recent agricultural reform legislation,â said Congressman John Garamendi, who along with two other lawmakers wrote a letter to India's Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu early this week. According to the letter, âhundreds of thousands of farmers from the states of Punjab and Haryana that have made their way to New Delhi to peacefully protest these new agricultural laws, and the Indian government has met these peaceful protestors with tear gas, water cannons, barricades, baton attacks, and more. âMany of these farmers have children, relatives, and friends who are US citizens, many of whom have reached out to us to share their concerns about these developments. We urge the Indian government to demonstrate its respect for these crucial democratic freedoms, and to be a model of democratic values in the vital Indo-Pacific regionâ. The letter, dated December 4, was released this week. The two other lawmakers who have expressed their concern on the protest were congressman Jim Costa and congresswoman Shelia Jackson Lee, members of the American Sikh Caucus. Thousands of farmers are currently staying put at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. There have been multiple rounds of talks between representatives of the protestors and the government but the logjam continues.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk had once famously said that it didnât matter to him if people had college degrees or even went to high school. Musk had said that he looks for âexceptional abilityâ or the evidence of it rather than degrees. As per a report by CNBC, Musk asks one question in every interview to find out if a person is telling the truth or not. The question he asks is, âTell me about some of the most difficult problems you worked on and how you solved them.â He explained that how asking this question helps. If the âpeople who really solved the problem know exactly how they solved it,â he said. If they know and have solved it then they can âdescribe the little detailsâ and those who havenât will not be able to do so. The premise is simple: if anyone is making something up or telling a lie, then he/she will not be able to back it with conviction. Musk in an interview had said that if people had made a significant accomplishment then âyou want to make sure if there was some significant accomplishment, were they really responsible, or was someone else more responsible?â He further said that, âUsually, someone who really had to struggle with a problem, they really understand the details, and they donât forget.â Interestingly, a study published in the Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition in December 2020 pointed out how Muskâs method can be effective in spotting liars. The study suggested that if the interviewees âprovide longer, more detailed statements about the event of interest, then the investigator will be better able to detect if they are telling the truth or lying.â

SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha on Tuesday announced sanction of over 10,000 loan cases for the union territory's budding entrepreneurs under various programmes. Sinha said his mantra for Jammu and Kashmir revolved around 'four Ps' - peace, progress, prosperity and people. âThe sanctioning of over 10,000 cases under B2V3 (back to village-3) self employment programme, economic package and 'My Town-My Pride' highlights the UT government's commitment to empower the youth which is one of the foremost priorities of J&K government,â he said. Sinha said 15,309 applications were received, out of which 10,828 have been sanctioned and an amount of Rs 100 cr has been disbursed to 6,734 applicants, identified under B2V3. âWe had taken up a target of covering at least 2 persons in each Panchayat who were in need of financial assistance for self employment,â he added. He said the administration is committed to cover every single aspirant within the UT, who wishes to set up his/her own business. âWhat distinguishes the effort this time is the fact that unlike in the past, where borrowers had to make several rounds of the bank to get a simple loan, the banks have been more than forthcoming towards helping the people,â he said. The officers went to the villages under B2V3 and My Town-My Pride, and identified the aspirants, the LG said. Sinha called upon the J&K Bank to not only extend financial assistance to these entrepreneurs but also provide hand-holding to them so that the youth who opt for self employment can set up sustainable businesses and flourish in their lives. The Lt Governor also handed over a cheque of Rs 250 crore to J&K Bank as commencement of disbursement of 5 per cent Interest Subvention and coverage of re-structured accounts following 2014 floods and 2016 agitation. âThis is only the beginning and as and when requests are received for further disbursement, we will continue to meet these requests in a timely manner,â he added. Providing much needed relief to the business community, the Lt Governor also announced that from January 1 next year, GST shall be reimbursed timely and automatically without delays. He said the government was strengthening the grass roots democratic set up as a three-tier Panchayati Raj System is being implemented for the first time in J&K. For empowerment of youth of J&K, Sinha said the administration is coming up with 'YES J&K' - a youth empowerment programme for youth engagement and employment. The intended programme will be an institutional mechanism for providing the necessary hand-holding and support to the youth to facilitate and nurture their capabilities, he added.

CHANDIGARH: In a step towards further empowerment of women, the Amarinder Singh government on Wednesday approved 33 per cent reservation for women in direct recruitment for the Punjab civil services, boards and corporations. The state cabinet, at a meeting presided by Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, approved the 'Punjab Civil Services (Reservation of Posts for Women) Rules, 2020' to provide such reservation for women for direct recruitment to posts in government, as well as in recruitment to Boards and Corporations in Group A, B, C and D posts, an official spokesperson said. The Cabinet also gave its nod to a bill to replace the 'Punjab State Vigilance Commission Ordinance, 2020'. It will be introduced in the next assembly session. "The establishment of the multi-member Commission, aimed at bringing in more transparency and check corruption among public servants, was approved by the Cabinet last month through the ordinance. "It is in line with the vision of Captain Amarinder Singh, who had steered the constitution of a similar commission back in 2006," the spokesperson said. The Commission was scrapped by the Akalis when they came to power in 2007. The Commission has been visualised as an independent body to exercise more effective superintendence over the functioning of the Vigilance Bureau and all departments of the state government in order to provide clean, fair and transparent administration, the spokesperson said. The Punjab State Vigilance Commission shall review the progress of investigations conducted by the Vigilance Bureau and cases of prosecution sanction pending with various departments of the Government. "The Vigilance Commission shall tender advice to the various departments of the Government, and other investigations on Vigilance matters. It has been empowered to give directions to the Vigilance Bureau for discharging the responsibility entrusted to it. "It has also been empowered to inquire or cause an inquiry/investigation to be made in respect of allegations made under the Prevention of Corruption Act and other relevant offences against public servants," the spokesperson said. The Cabinet cleared the decks for the state to launch its own SC Post Matric Scholarship Scheme, in place of the Centre's scheme, in order to facilitate SC students to pursue higher education in government and private institutions. Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also announced raising the cap in income criteria from earlier Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 4 lakh to accommodate more students. The new scheme will be known as Dr BR Ambedkar SC Post Matric Scholarship Scheme and it will be effective from academic session 2021-22, the spokesperson said. The total financial implication of the proposal is estimated to be about Rs 600 crore. "The scheme will come as a relief to hundreds of thousands of SC students who were deprived of the opportunity to pursue higher learning after the Government of India suddenly withdrew from its Post Matric Scholarship Scheme in 2018," the spokesperson said.

NEW DELHI: Amidst protest from opposition and a section of farmer's organisations, the Monsoon Session of the Lok Sabha passed three agriculture sector bills which will replace the existing ordinances once they are passed by the Rajya Sabha also. On Thursday, SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned from the Union council of ministers protesting against the bills which she said are anti-farmer and will destroy the agriculture sector in Punjab. Here is all you need to know about the three bills: 1. Bill on agri marketFarmer's Produce Trade and Commerce(Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020Provisions* To create an ecosystem where farmers and traders enjoy the freedom to sell and purchase farm produce outide registered 'mandis' under states' APMCs. * To promote barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade of farmers' produce * To reduce marketing/transportation costs and help farmers in getting better prices * To provide a facilitative framework for electronic trading Opposition* States will lose revenue as they won't be able to collect 'mandi fees' if farmers sell their produce outside registered APMC markets. * What happens to 'commission agents' in states if entire farm trade moves out of mandis? * It may eventually end the MSP-based procurement system. * Electronic trading like in e-NAM uses physical 'mandi' structure. What will happen to e-NAM if 'mandis' are destroyed in absence of trading? New farm bill 2020: Who is protesting &amp; why2. Bill on contract farmingThe Farmer (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020Provisions* Farmers can enter into a contract with agribusiness firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters or large retailers for sale of future farming produce at a pre-agreed price * Marginal and small farmers, with land less than five hectares, to gain via aggregation and contract (Marginal and small farmers account for 86% of total farmers in India) * To transfer the risk of market unpredictability from farmers to sponsors * To enable farmers to access modern tech and get better inputs * To reduce cost of marketing and boost farmer's income. * Farmers can engage in direct marketing by eliminating intermediaries for full price realisation * Effective dispute resolution mechanism with redressal timelines. Opposition* Farmers in contract farming arrangements will be the weaker players in terms of their ability to negotiate what they need * The sponsors may not like to deal with a multitude of small and marginal farmers * Being big private companies, exporters, wholesalers and processors, the sponsors will have an edge in disputes. 3. Bill relating to commoditiesThe Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020Provisions* To remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, onion and potatoes from the list of essential commodities. It will do away with the imposition of stockholding limits on such items except under "extraordinary circumstances" like war * This provision will attract private sector/FDI into farm sector as it will remove fears of private investors of excessive regulatory interference in business operations. * To bring investment for farm infrastructure like cold storages, and modernising food supply chain. * To help both farmers and consumers by bringing in price stability. * To create competitive market environment and cut wastage of farm produce. Opposition* Price limits for "extraordinary circumstances" are so high that they are likely to be never triggered. * Big companies will have the freedom to stock commodities- it means they will dictate terms to farmers which may lead to less prices for the cultivators. * Recent decision on export ban on onion creates doubt on its implementation.

NEW DELHI: The novel coronavirus is now spreading much more rapidly outside China than within the country, leading the world into uncharted territory, but the outbreak can still be contained, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The virus has so far claimed over 3,000 lives and there are over 90,000 confirmed cases.  What is coronavirus?Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. What are zoonotic?Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. What are the signs of infections?Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. How to prevent infection from spreading?Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Stay home when you are sick. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Who should wear a facemask?It is not necessary for people who are well to wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases. Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others, Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said. What is the treatment for novel coronavirus?There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19. People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions. People who think they may have been exposed to COVID-19 should contact their healthcare provider immediately. Here is a list of dos and don'ts issued by the government to stall the spread of the virus in the country âDo's Cover your nose and mouth with disposable tissue or handkerchief Frequently wash your hands with soap and water Avoid crowded places Person suffering from Influenza like illness must be confined at home Stay more than one arm's length distance from persons sick with flu Take adequate sleep and rest Drink plenty of water/liquids and eat nutritious food Person suspected with Influenza like illness must consult doctor Don'ts Touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands while coughing or sneezing Hugging, kissing and shaking hands while greeting Spitting in public places Taking medicines without consulting doctor Disposal of used napkin or tissue paper in open areas Touching surfaces usually used by public (railing, door, gates, etc)

NEW DELHI: Several parts of the country, including Odisha, Kerala, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Delhi, are witnessing a solar eclipse on Thursday morning, which is said to the last one of the decade. The solar eclipse, which occurs when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, began at around 8:17 am and will continue till 10:57 am today. It is also being referred to as "ring of fire" and "Surya Grahan" in Hindi. The beginning of the eclipse can be first seen from the Arabian sea coast of Oman at around 7:59 hours IST and the annular eclipse will become first visible in west of Baharain at 09:06 hours IST, Duari added. Here is all you want to know about solar eclipse.  What is a solar eclipse? A solar eclipse occurs when a portion of the Earth is engulfed in a shadow cast by the Moon which fully or partially blocks sunlight. This occurs when the Sun, Moon and Earth are aligned. Such alignment coincides with a new moon indicating the Moon is closest to the ecliptic plane. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured. If the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit, a little closer to the Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every new moon. However, since the Moon's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, its shadow usually misses Earth. A solar eclipse can only occur when the Moon is close enough to the ecliptic plane during a new moon. What is a âRing of Fireâ during solar eclipse?We do not get to see a âRing of Fireâ during all solar eclipses and those solar eclipses where a âRing of Fireâ is visible is called an annular solar eclipse. During such an eclipse, the centre of the Sun is covered by the Moon in such a way that the outer edge of the Sun is left visible and it looks like a ring. When viewed from a long distance it looks like a ring of fire around the Moon called the 'annulus'. However, when an annular solar eclipse takes place, the âRing of Fireâ is not visible from all places on earth. As a result of which the annular solar eclipse may look like a partial solar eclipse. When does an annular solar eclipse happen? We do not get to see a 'ring of fire' during all solar eclipse. For an annular solar eclipse to take place, three things need to happen â there should be a New Moon, the Moon should be at or very near a lunar node so that the Sun, Moon and the Earth all are in a straight line and the Moon should be near the apogee (the farthest point of the Moon from Earth) so that the outer edge of the Sun is visible. The 'Ring of Fire' is visible only when all these three parameters are met. When will solar eclipse start on Wednesday According to the India Meteorological Departmentâs Kolkata-based Positional Astronomy Centre, the solar eclipse will begin at 8am on Thursday. It will slowly increase in intensity before peaking two hours later. It will end at 1.35pm. Places where solar eclipse can be seen In Delhi, the partial eclipse will begin at 8.17am while the greatest eclipse will start at 9.30. The partial eclipse will end at 10.56am and the total duration of the eclipse will be 2 hours and 39 minutes. The solar eclipse will be at its maximum intensity at 10.47am and will remain so for a little under four minutes. The eclipse will be visible in some parts of India, Sri Lanka, UAE, Sumatra, Australia, Philippines and Singapore. People living in Ooty, Mangalore, Coimbatore, Shivagange, Tiruchirappalli and Kasaragod will be able to see the âring of fireâ. However, residents of New Delhi, Pune, Jaipur, Lucknow, Kanpur, Nagpur, Indore, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Surat, Bhopal, Visakhapatnam, Ludhiana and Agra will only witness a partial solar eclipse. âFrom India, annular phase will be visible in the morning after sunrise from some places within a narrow corridor of southern part of the country (parts of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu) and it will be seen as partial solar eclipse from the rest part of the country. The narrow corridor of annular phase of the eclipse will pass through the southern part of the country through certain places like Kannur, Coimbatore, Kozhikode, Madurai, Mangalore, Ooty, Tiruchirappalli, etc,â a bulletin of the Positional Astronomy Centre stated.  Precautions while watching the solar eclipse âThe eclipse should not be viewed with the naked eye. It will cause permanent damage of the eyes even when the moon covers most portion of the sun. Safe technique to observe the solar eclipse is either by using proper filter like aluminised Mylar, black polymer and welding glass of shade number 14 or by making projection of the sunâs image on a white board by a telescope,â the bulletin stated.  Dos and donts on solar eclipseExposing your eyes to the sun without proper eye protection during a solar eclipse can cause âeclipse blindnessâ or retinal burns, also known as solar retinopathy, say opthalmologists. "Radiation from the sun is so powerful that regular sunglasses or lens in cameras will not be able to filter," says senior opthalmologist Dr Mohan Rajan. "Looking at the sun for more than 90 seconds exceeds threshold of retinal damage," he said. The harmful ultra violet rays from the sun can destroy cells in the retina that transmit what you see to the brain, sometimes causing permanent damage. Many times people it can occur without pain. "Symptoms can take a few hours to a few days after viewing the solar eclipse to realize the damage that has occurred," he said. Many experience loss of central vision (solar retinopathy) , distorted vision or altered color vision. Do not watch the eclipse on * Smartphone * Camera viewfinder, telescope or binoculars * Unsafe filters or glasses. Dos Use specifically designed for viewing a solar eclipse. Follow directions to use carefully

NEW DELHI: Amid the furore over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the Union Cabinet on Tuesday   approved funds   to the tune of over Rs 8,500 crore for updating the National Population Register (NPR), officials have said. The NPR exercise is to commence from April next year. The NPR is a list of "usual residents" of the country. Updating of this data was done during 2015 by conducting door-to-door survey. The digitisation of the updated information has been completed. Meanwhile, the Left parties announced a seven-day nationwide protest from January 1 to 7 and a general strike on January 8 against the CAA, the NPR and the NRC. In a joint statement, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Communist Party of India, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist)-Liberation, the All India Forward Bloc and the Revolutionary Socialist Party said the protest programme was announced in solidarity with the trade unions, which have also called a general strike on January 8. Now it has been decided to update the National Population Register along with the house-listing phase of Census 2021 from April to September 2020 in all the states/union territories, except Assam.  What is NPR?The National Population Register (NPR) is a register of usual residents of the country being prepared at the local (village/sub-town), sub-district, district, state and national level under provisions of the Citizenship Act 1955 and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003. It is mandatory for every usual resident of India to register in the NPR. Under the NPR, a usual resident is defined as a person who has resided in a local area for the past six months or more or a person who intends to reside in that area for the next six months or more. What is its purpose? NPR's purpose is to create a comprehensive identity database of every usual resident in the country. The database would contain demographic as well as biometric particulars. Aadhaar, mobile number, PAN, driving license, voter ID details and Indian passport numbers are among the details that will be collected from all usual residents of India. Sharing of Aadhaar is voluntary in view of the Supreme Court ruling in this regard. What are the demographic details required?Name of person Relationship to head of household, Fatherâs name, Motherâs name, Spouseâs name (if married), Sex, Date of Birth, Marital status, Place of birth, Nationality (as declared), Present address of usual residence, Duration of stay at present address, Permanent residential address, Occupation/Activity, Educational qualification. What is the current status? Data for NPR was collected in 2010 during collection of data for Census of India 2011. It was updated in 2015 through a door-to-door survey. The digitisation of the updated information has been completed. NPR data will now be updated along with the house-listing phase of Census 2021 from April-September 2020 in all states except Assam. A gazette notification to this effect has already been published by the central government. Which states have blocked NPR? The West Bengal government this month stayed all activities related to the preparation and updation of NPR. The decision came amid violent protests in parts of the state over CAA and chief minister Mamata Banerjee reiterating that the law and the proposed pan-India NRC will not be implemented in the state. Mamata Banerjee said, "All activities regarding the preparation and updation of the National Population Register are stayed in West Bengal. No activity regarding NRP may be taken up without clearance from the government of West Bengal." Kerala and Rajasthan have followed suit, saying they will not work on compiling the NPR as mandated by the Centre to record 'basic information' on citizens. "After considering the concerns raised in the wake of the 2019 amendment in the Citizenship Act, the state government has decided not to cooperate with the process to update the NPR to facilitate the preparation of the NRC," the office of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in a statement last week. Why is Assam excludedAs of now, the NPR exercise is not being undertaken in Assam. Assam recently had the NRC exercise undertaken to identify and detain illegal immigrants. The purpose of a pan-India NRC it to detect illegal immigrants and detain them, irrespective of faith, however there are concerns it could arbitrarily exclude genuine Indian citizens. How can NPR data be accessed NPR data will not be put in the public domain but will remain a secure database accessible to the relevant user through password protected protocols. The government says it will use the data to enhance the targeting of beneficiary-oriented schemes and will have implications on improving internal security.

NEW DELHI: Amid the protests across the country over the amended Citizenship Act, the government has said that there is no link between the new law and NRC. Home minister Amit Shah had earlier set a 2024 deadline for implementing the NRC across the country. Meanwhile, the Centre on Thursday clarified that the exercise to prepare an all-India National Register for Citizens â National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC), as per the Citizenship Rules, 2003 â was yet to be notified and as and when it is done, rules and instructions would be framed in such a way that no Indian citizen is inconvenienced. Here is all you need to know about the NRC:  What is NRC (National Register of Citizens)?NRC means the National Register of Citizens. NRC is a list of Assam's residents â prepared to identify bonafide residents and deport illegal migrants in the northeastern state bordering Bangladesh. So far, this has been a state-specific exercise to keep its ethnic uniqueness unaltered.But ever since its implementation, there has been a growing demand for its nationwide implementation. Many top BJP leaders, including home minister Amit Shah have proposed that the NRC in Assam be implemented across India. It effectively suggests to bring a legislation that will enable the government to identify infiltrators who have been living in India illegally, detain them and finally deport them where they came from. Who stands to lose?The proposed Bill, which till now remains just a proposal, if implemented will target illegal immigrants in India. But Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhist, Jains and Parsis coming from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh won't be affected, if they claim they have arrived India after fleeing religious persecution. It essentially means, if a nationwide NRC is implemented as proposed, any illegal immigrant from other than Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, will be affected. And as for those three nations, people coming from there who belong to the Muslim community will also be affected as they are not included in the Citizenship Amendment Act. Who will be excluded?As proposed, if a nationwide NRC comes in place, the affected will be detained and taken to large detention centres, as it is happening in Assam. After that, the ministry of external affairs will get in touch with the concerned nations. If the details of the detained are matched and accepted by the concerned nations, deportations will follow. Assam is setting up detention centres exclusively for those declared foreigners after exhausting all legal routes. Repatriation of such people looks difficult as India and Bangladesh do not have any treaty in this regard at this point of time. The politics of NRCAmit Shah has been raising the pitch for a nationwide NRC for some time now. As late as this October, Shah raised the matter in West Bengal, not far from Assam. In Haryana, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar too made the promise of bringing the NRC in the state during his election campaigning. Even Mohan Bhagwat, the RSS supremo has been pitching for the same, though behind closed doors. Possibility of NRC in the rest of IndiaThe Centre has been pushing for NRCs in every state. Nagaland has already started an exercise to create a similar database of citizens known as the Register of Indigenous Inhabitants. The Centre has also announced plans for a National Population Register (NPR) which will contain demographic and bio-metric details of citizens. A pilot NPR project was launched when the UPA government was in power but was not completed.  What is NRC (National Register of Citizens)?NRC means the National Register of Citizens.

 What is Citizenship (Amendment) Bill?The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill seeks to provide Indian nationality to six communities â Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis, Jains and Buddhists fleeing persecution from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.The bill amends the Citizenship Act, 1955 to make illegal migrants in the select categories eligible for citizenship. What does the government say:Home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday rejected the Opposition's charge that the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was anti-Muslim, saying it does not take away the citizenship of any Indian Muslim and only seeks to given the same to persecuted minorities of three neighbouring countries. Replying to a debate on the bill in Rajya Sabha, he said the need to bring this Bill would not have arisen had Partition not taken place on the basis of religion. The Bill does not snatch citizenship of Muslims and their is no need for them to have any fear, he said. What does the opposition say:The legislation has been attacked by opposition parties, minority outfits and others for leaving out Muslims and also on the grounds that it is at odds with the Constitution, which does not differentiate between citizens on the basis of their faith. Who are the parties opposing/supporting the Bill?Congress, Trinamool, DMK, Samajwadi Party, RJD and Left, and even parties like Shiv Sena and BJD have expressed reservations. BJP's Assam ally AGP seemed to have warmed up to the idea of CAB after the government assured changes to the Bill. The government has the support of regional allies â Akali Dal and JD(U). AIADMK also voted in favour of the Bill in Rajya Sabha. Why are some northeast states opposing the Bill?The CAB has sparked resentment in the northeast as it is feared that granting citizenship to foreign refugees will undermine the ethnic communities living in these regions.There are indications that the government is working out a compromise. Formulations like provision of citizenship not leading to residency status in the smaller north-east states were discussed. Why has BJP's Assam-ally AGP taken a U-turn on CAB?In January last year, BJP's ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) had pulled out of NDA after Lok Sabha passed the earlier version of the Bill, which BJP had introduced in Parliament in 2016. When the Bill lapsed in the Lok Sabha, AGP returned to the alliance.Recently, the AGP has indicated a U-turn on the proposed Bill. âWe have to move forward with the reality â neither can we expel lakhs of illegal migrants nor will Bangladesh ever take them back. We had our government twice in the past but we could not even identify the illegal migrants. Unfortunately, the Assam Accord has only gathered dust for over 34 years," AGP member and Assam minister Atul Bora said.

RTI Amendment Bill: Explained

NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Monday passed Right to Information (Amendment) Bill, after division that allows the Central government to notify the term of office for the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and Information Commissioners (ICs) with the Opposition slamming the measure as diluting the provisions of the legislation. The Right to Information (Amendment) Bill, 2019 was passed with 218 members voting in its favour and 79 against it after a reply by Minister of state for personnel, public grievances and pensions, Jitendra Singh. The 2005 Act was enacted during the first Congress-led government UPA government. According to the activists, the efficacy of the RTI Act, allowing any Indian to seek information from any authority on the payment of Rs 10, hinges closely on the independence of the CIC and its equivalents in the states â state information commissions that adjudicate the matter in case information is not furnished to applicants within the parameters of the law. Here is explain: Whatâs changed in Parliament: While Lok Sabha was never a problem, the NDAâs weakling status in the Rajya Sabha prevented it from pushing several contentious bills â with its total strength in the Upper House less than that of the Opposition. However, that may not be a problem any longer as the NDA, along with some âfriendlyâ parties such as the TRS, YSRCP, BJD and others has a strength of 127 in the 245 member House of Elders, more than the halfway mark of 123. That should help it push through the bill after it passes in the Lok Sabha. Whatâs in the bill: The amended bill does away with the fixed tenure of five years for the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and the Information Commissioners (IC) â instead, they will serve for a tenure determined by the Central government. Moreover, the salary of the CIC and the ICs which are currently benchmarked with the salary of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and the Election Commissioners respectively, which in turn are benchmarked with the salary of a Supreme Court judge, amount to Rs 2.50 lakh, along with a monthly allowance of Rs 34,000 per month â plus the usual perks like rent free furnished accommodation and 200 litres of fuel every month. The amended bill gives the government to fix the salary, which could be lower â given that the Information Commission is a statutory body unlike the EC which is a constitutional body. However, the current incumbentsâ salaries will not be affected by the amendment. How will that affect RTI? Currently, the CIC and the IC are chosen by a three member panel of the PM, the Leader of Opposition or leader of the largest opposition party in Lok Sabha and a Cabinet minister nominated by the PM. Similarly, the State Chief Information Commissioners (SCIC) and State Information Commissioners (SIC) are chosen by a three member panel comprising the state CM, the stateâs leader of opposition or leader of the largest opposition party in the state assembly and a state cabinet minister nominated the chief minister. The amended bill arrogates the power of appointment and the term as well as the salary of SCIC and SIC to the Central government â which nullifies the independence of the state legislatures. Even the CIC and the ICs will serve at the pleasure of the government â raising the possibility that they would be more interested in ensuring the longevity of their tenures rather than serving the citizensâ interests. Termination of terms? Current rules stipulate that no CIC, IC, SCIC or SIC serve more than one term, for a maximum period of 5 years or till the age of 65, whichever is earlier. For ICs and SICs, if one of them is nominated to the post of CIC or SCIC, his/her total tenure as both IC and CIC or SIC and SCIC can not exceed 5 years. While the new bill gives the government the power to fix tenures, it's not clear whether an incumbent seen as pliable or âfriendlyâ to the Centre may get to serve more than one term. Appointments & dismissals: If the tenure of the CIC, IC, SCIC and SIC are to be fixed by the Centre, it may follow that their removal from office may also be dependent on the Centre â whereas in the original bill, the CIC and IC may be removed only by the President â and the state Governor in case of SCIC and SIC â after an enquiry by the Supreme Court finds reason for their dismissal from office.
