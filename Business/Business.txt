NEW DELHI: Equity indices fell on Wednesday with the benchmark BSE sensex falling over 900 points, dragged by banking and financial stocks. The 30-share BSE index plunged 938 points or 1.94 per cent to finish at 47,410; while the broader NSE Nifty settled 271 points or 1.91 per cent lower at 13,968. Axis Bank, Titan, IndusInd Bank, HDFC Bank Dr Reddy's, HDFC and Asian Paints were the top losers in the sensex pack falling up to 4.05 per cent. While Tech Mahindra, ITC, PowerGrid and Ultra Cemco were the top gainers rising up to 2.57 per cent. Shares of Reliance Industries slipped as much as 2.29% to an over one-month low of Rs 1,895 after US e-commerce giant Amazon sought to block Future Group's $3.4 billion retail asset sale to the conglomerate, making it the top drag on Nifty. Amazon requested an Indian court to enforce a Singapore arbitrator's order that Reliance's deal with the Future Group be put on hold, Reuters reported on Monday. Amazon moves Delhi HC to enforce Singapore order and block Reliance-Future dealFuture Retail's shares fell 5% on the news, after Amazon.com also called for Future Group's chief executive officer to be detained. "There is some overhang in the markets due to negative global cues and some nervousness ahead of the budget because of which people are lightening their positions" Siddhartha Khemka, head of retail research at Motilal Oswal Securities in Mumbai, told news agency Reuters. Analysts also said that investors have preferred taking profits off the table ahead of the Union Budget and F&O expiry. Adding to the pressure, Asian shares also slipped as investors looked to the Federal Reserve's guidance on monetary policy. Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank slipped 1.58%, after JP Morgan downgraded the stock as the lender reported quarterly results below expectations. Meanwhile, foreign investors sold equities worth Rs 765.30 crore on a net basis in the Indian capital market on Monday, exchange data showed. (With inputs from agencies)

NEW YORK: "Withdrawn". A single word on a thick bureaucratic file on the seventh day of the Biden administration delivered a huge win for spouses of workers on H-1B visas in the US who spent the last four years worried sick that their work authorisations would be killed off. The latest development brings to an end years of effort by the Donald Trump administration to rescind an Obama era regulation that allowed a certain subset of spouses of H-1B visa holders to work in the US. Up until the summer of 2015, H-4 visa holders could not legally hold paid employment in the United States. Almost as soon as Obama changed the game, the lawsuits followed and then the Trump presidency took the attack on the H-4 work permit to a whole new level. On text messages, chat groups and online threads, the outpouring of relief played out online on Tuesday evening. "Great news! Hopefully H4EAD delays will be ending soon which is leading to a long wait for dependent spouses," tweeted Rashi Bhatnagar. Sharmistha Mohapatra posted, "Big win for H4 EAD holders today. Former Pres Trump's EO to rescind H4 EAD is now withdrawn by POTUS. Let's hope excruciating long wait times often resulting in job loss is taken away too!" From the time the skewering of the H-4 work permit (called the EAD) began in Fall 2017, the proposed rule has been published seven times for ongoing review, keeping the H-4 community on cliff-edge. The Trump government justified the move saying it is "economically significant" and aligns with the "Buy American and Hire American" executive order, which was mostly code for keeping foreign workers out of the US and flinging red meat to the Trump base. Now, the backlink to that Trump executive order ends up as a 404 (page not found) error and re-routes to the Biden White House.

NEW DELHI: China's ByteDance is cutting the size of its 2,000-plus India team and is unsure when it will make a comeback, the company told employees in an internal memo on Wednesday, months after its popular TikTok video app was banned. The move came after India this month decided to retain its ban on TikTok and 58 other Chinese apps following responses from the companies on issues such as compliance and privacy. TikTok, WeChat, Baidu and UC Browser among 59 Chinese apps permanently banned in IndiaThe ban dates from last year when political tension between the neighbours rose over their disputed border. "We initially hoped that this situation would be short-lived ... we find that has not been the case," ByteDance wrote in the memo which was seen by Reuters. "We simply cannot responsibly stay fully staffed while our apps remain un-operational ... we don't know when we will make a comeback in India" In a statement, the company said it was disappointing that despite its efforts it had not received a clear direction on how and when its apps could be reinstated. It did not specify how many employees would lose their jobs. Before the ban, India had been one of TikTok's largest markets and ByteDance in 2019 had laid out plans to invest $1 billion in India. At the time of last year's ban, the Indian government described the apps as prejudicial to the "sovereignty and integrity of India". The move followed a skirmish with Chinese troops. In the United States, the previous Trump administration ordered ByteDance to divest TikTok citing national security concerns, and sought to impose restrictions that would have effectively barred its use. TikTok has also come under scrutiny in Australia for any risks it may pose to users from around potential foreign interference and data privacy issues.

SAN FRANCISCO: A spat erupted Tuesday between Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk as the tech titans' space firms exchanged barbs over their rival satellite internet projects being evaluated by regulators. Amazon, founded and led by Bezos, put out a statement claiming Musk's rival SpaceX project Starlink was seeking design changes that could "create a more dangerous environment for collisions in space" and also increase radio interference. "Despite what SpaceX posts on Twitter, it is SpaceX's proposed changes that would hamstring competition among satellite systems," Amazon said in a statement, outlining its objections to regulators. "It is clearly in SpaceX's interest to smother competition in the cradle if they can, but it is certainly not in the public's interest." Musk meanwhile fired off his own objection to Amazon's complaint, claiming that his plan is moving faster than his rival's. "It does not serve the public to hamstring Starlink today for an Amazon satellite system that is at best several years away from operation," Musk tweeted. @thesheetztweetz It does not serve the public to hamstring Starlink today for an Amazon satellite system that is atâ¦ https://t.co/sNiGKxdXFP— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) 1611658035000Musk, who is also the founder of Tesla and recently overtook Bezos as the world's richest person, is in a race against Amazon's $10 billion Project Kuiper space-based internet delivery system, which has won US regulatory approval to deploy more than 3,000 low-orbit satellites. SpaceX has been deploying small satellites to form a global broadband system and is lobbying regulators for permission to move them into lower orbits, which has prompted Amazon's concerns. SpaceX argued in a letter to the Federal Communications Commission that the orbit modifications being sought would not increase chances of interfering with rival satellites. It contended that any claims of such interference were "misleading," and that Amazon was trying to "stifle competition." SpaceX on Sunday launched its Falcon 9 rocket carrying a record number of satellites on board. Scientists have expressed concerns about the number of objects clogging the space around Earth. SpaceX say their satellites are designed to burn up in the atmosphere within a few years. Project Kuiper aims to deliver satellite-based broadband services in the United States, and eventually around the world, and may offer connectivity for wireless carriers and 5G networks.

NEW DELHI: With International Monetary Fund (IMF) projecting that India will reclaim the status of world's fastest-growing economy and projected its growth at 11.5 per cent in 2021, experts on Wednesday said that India is rebounding to achieve the target of a $5 trillion economy. Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal termed the IMF projections for India as "Bright star in the global economy." "Bright Star in Global Economy: India to continue its growth story at rapid pace under PM @NarendraModi ji, with @IMFNews projecting an impressive 11.5% growth rate for India in 2021. It makes India only major economy to register double-digit growth in 2021," Goyal tweeted. Charan Singh, CEO, EGROW Foundation and former RBI chair professor said, "As was expected, and I had been arguing that India's fundamentals are strong, IMF, in its latest release has projected India's growth at 11.5 per cent in 2021 and 6.8 per cent in 2022. This is the highest growth rate to be recorded by any country." Singh said that IMF observed that the substantial revision in India's growth projection is because of stronger than expected recovery after lockdown. "Hence, India has saved the lives of people in lockdown, and now galloping to recoup growth trajectory. This has been due to the well-calibrated, adequately sequenced policies of the Government. Thus, a V-shaped recovery is on the way, and India is rebounding, to achieve a $5 Trillion Economy, despite the Covid set-back," he added. DK Mishra, a market expert, said that Covid-19 pandemic has impacted worldwide economies in a big way but Indian economy has come out of initial hits due to measures taken by government and strong consumer demands. "The same is evident from strong GST collections and good agricultural growth. The projection for 11.50 per cent growth by IMF in GDP is yet another confirmation of the strong recovery of the economy. The future outlook with the Covid vaccine in the market will be good for our economy," he said. In its latest World Economic Outlook update released on Tuesday, the IMF predicted that India's gross domestic product (GDP) will grow at the pace of 11.5 per cent in 2021. IMF projections show that India's economy will grow much better than China which is predicted to grow at 8.1 per cent, followed by Spain (5.9 per cent), France (5.5 per cent) and United States (5.1 per cent).

LOS ANGELES: Jeff Bezos wants $1.7 million from his girlfriendâs brother to cover legal fees the worldâs second-richest person racked up successfully defending a defamation lawsuit. Lauren Sanchezâs brother, Michael Sanchez, sued Bezos and his security consultant, Gavin de Becker, claiming they defamed him by telling journalists that Michael had been the source of nude photos of Bezos that were leaked to the National Enquirer. The case was thrown out because Michael Sanchezâs only evidence was that he had heard that from journalists. Michael Sanchez betrayed his sister and Bezos by selling their private communications to the tabloid for $200,000 and then doubled down by filing a lawsuit, intended to harass Bezos into a settlement âby threatening discovery and public disclosure of private matters,â Bezos, with a net worth of $193 billion, said in his request filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court. âMr Bezosâs fee request is obscene, even grotesque, on many levels,â Tom Warren, an attorney for Michael Sanchez, said in an email. A California state judge in November threw out Sanchezâs lawsuit under a state law that allows for expedited dismissal of baseless lawsuits over protected speech. Under the anti-Slapp statute, the prevailing defendant is entitled to have legal costs reimbursed by the plaintiff. Bezos went public in 2019 with what he said was an extortion attempt by the National Enquirer. He said it had threatened to publish more details of his relationship with Lauren Sanchez as well as revealing photos if he didnât stop investigating what had prompted a January 2019 expose about their affair while Bezos was still married to MacKenzie Scott. They divorced in 2019. The case is Sanchez v Bezos, 20ST-cv-04212, California Superior Court, Los Angeles County.

NEW DELHI: The government is set to amend laws to streamline the functioning, especially the disciplinary aspects, of three professional institutes â the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), Institute of Cost and Works Accountants of India (ICWAI) and Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI). A bill to amend relevant provisions of laws governing the three bodies is expected to be introduced during the second half of the budget session of Parliament. The idea is to step up oversight on the three bodies after a committee suggested several changes almost three years ago. In fact, some of the proposals have been accepted, the legal changes are being undertaken in consultation with the institutes. ICAI itself has been open to changes in recent months and has sought to simplify the process in cases such as those where the Quality Review Board suggests disciplinary action against its members, who are chartered accountants. The disciplinary track record of ICAI had come under the scanner a few years ago, with even Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagging it at the time of the launch of goods and services tax. Subsequently, the role of auditors had come under scrutiny after the collapse of IL&FS and the government had set up the National Financial Reporting Authority to look at important cases. As part of the proposal, the government intends to have a say in the appointment of secretaries of the institutes and directors responsible for discipline of the professionals. At one time, the ministry of corporate affairs, which is piloting the bill, was looking to appoint government officers in these roles. The committee headed by Meenakshi Dutta Ghosh, a former civil servant, had suggested that the disciplinary platform should be independent of the institute, while pointing out that the current mechanism needed to be revamped.

Union Budget 2021: The case for a higher standard deduction

NEW DELHI: With work from home becoming the new normal, it is going to be difficult for the finance minister to separate salary from business income. Raising the standard deduction for salaried employees may help level the field.Two years ago, in July 2019, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented her maiden budget -- and the first Budget of the second term of the NDA government. In that Budget, she hiked the standard deduction for salaried employees to Rs 50,000 from Rs 40,000. Union Budget 2021-22: Complete coverageThe standard deduction is an amount that is deducted from an individualâs salaried taxable income, thus reducing the taxable income. Clearly, if the government wants to put more money in the hands of the taxpayer (as it may need to in order to boost demand that has been choked by Covid-related lockdowns), a substantial increase in the standard deduction makes sense. Except that the finance minister, in the Budget presented in February 2020, had eliminated the standard deduction for taxpayers who opted to enter a new tax regime where lower tax slabs were offered to those who forgo the standard deduction and a host of other exemptions. These tax slabs are 5 to 10 percentage points lower than the older slabs -- at the lower end of the income scale. At the higher end (income of Rs 15 lakh plus), the tax rate remains the same. Tax mavens have discussed the new scheme at length, and see it as the governmentâs first, exploratory move into a no-exemption regime. Is this fair to salaried employees? In an article written in June 2019 by EY, it was made clear that income-tax rules seem skewed against salaried employees. While businesspeople and consultants can claim exemptions against all kinds of expenses every month, salaried employees have far fewer options. Tax is deducted at source by the employer, significantly reducing take-home pay. New, or old: Which tax regime makes the most sense for you?EY also offered a hypothetical case of a salaried employee and a consultant. Both make the same gross income of Rs 30 lakh, one as salary and one as fees. Post tax, however, the story is vastly different. The salaried employee pays Rs 6.73 lakh in taxes. The consultant, meanwhile, pays Rs 2.18 lakh. The salaried employee takes home Rs 4.55 lakh less than the consultant. The finance ministry disagreed with this reading. In a written response, the ministry said: âThe tax paid on taxable salary income and on gross amount of professional receipts cannot be compared as the taxable income in case of professionals is computed after allowing all the expenses incurred for carrying-out the profession. These expenses include rent for office space, salaries & wages of employees, electricity expenses for the office, printing & stationery etc. However, in respect of a salaried individual, there is no requirement to maintain any office and the office expenses are borne by the employer. The only major expenses required to be incurred by a salaried individual for earning salary income is the expense incurred for commuting to the office. For this purpose and other miscellaneous petty expenses which a salaried individual might have to incur, a standard deduction is allowed to the salaried taxpayer which is currently Rs. 50,000.â The purpose of the EY piece was not to question the expenses legitimately allowed to professionals. Rather, it was to highlight the fact that salaried employees had very few options to claim equally legitimate expenses. Now more than ever, people are working from home and are using computers and phones for official work. But they are not allowed to claim even a part of what they spend on buying such equipment as deduction from income. Some countries, such as Denmark and South Korea, allow such deductions to salary earners, and this is something the government could seriously consider now that âwork from homeâ is not just accepted but necessary. Budget 2021: Why finance minister should not bring in any new taxThe few deductions that are allowed to the salaried are unrealistically lower than the actual cost of the services. For instance, the limits for childrenâs education allowance (Rs 100 per month per child, up to two children) and hostel allowance (Rs 300 per month per child, up to two children) were last revised almost two decades ago. The governmentâs claim that standard deduction of Rs 50,000 will take care of incidental expenses rings somewhat hollow. EY said the re-introduced standard deduction subsumed the tax-exempt transport allowance â an annual figure of Rs 19,200 and the medical reimbursement that could be claimed up to Rs 15,000. In short, the end benefit was just an annual incremental net reduction in taxable income of Rs 5,800. Now compare this to what a professional can claim. For starters, thereâs the presumptive tax scheme. Under this, professionals can file their return declaring 50% of their gross returns (subject to gross receipts not exceeding Rs 50 lakh). After the tax-saving investments under Section 80 are accounted for, the professional needs to pay tax only on the balance income. Of course, receipts in excess of Rs 50 lakh will need to be audited and the actual expenses as per the audited accounts are allowed as a deduction. While presumptive tax has really helped smaller and medium-sized professionals, it has resulted in stark disparity between salaried employees and consultants with the same income. The finance ministry disagrees, and says that in the case of presumptive tax, âit is presumed that 50% of his gross receipts are expended towards various expenses required to be incurred for carrying out his profession. However, this is not a standard deduction and it has also been provided in the Act that if the professional incurs expenses less than 50% of the gross receipts, then he has to declare the higher income.â The previous finance minister, the late Arun Jaitley, saw this in a different light. In his 2018-19 budget speech, Jaitley highlighted the fact that an average salary earner pays three times more income tax (Rs 76,306) than a non-salaried taxpayer does (Rs 25,753) â both figures from the budget speech. It will be interesting to see how the finance ministry deals with the issues of presumptive tax and standard deduction in a year when almost the entire country worked out of home. The pandemic-induced lockdown and subsequent restrictions on movement meant that salaried employees and professionals alike spent on office infrastructure at home. This new normal is unlikely to vanish in a hurry. Will the upcoming Budget take this into account when framing the new tax rules? (A version of this article was published in July 2019)

NEW DELHI: China's ByteDance is cutting the size of its 2,000-plus India team and is unsure when it will make a comeback, the company told employees in an internal memo on Wednesday, months after its popular TikTok video app was banned. The move came after India this month decided to retain its ban on TikTok and 58 other Chinese apps following responses from the companies on issues such as compliance and privacy. TikTok, WeChat, Baidu and UC Browser among 59 Chinese apps permanently banned in IndiaThe ban dates from last year when political tension between the neighbours rose over their disputed border. "We initially hoped that this situation would be short-lived ... we find that has not been the case," ByteDance wrote in the memo which was seen by Reuters. "We simply cannot responsibly stay fully staffed while our apps remain un-operational ... we don't know when we will make a comeback in India" In a statement, the company said it was disappointing that despite its efforts it had not received a clear direction on how and when its apps could be reinstated. It did not specify how many employees would lose their jobs. Before the ban, India had been one of TikTok's largest markets and ByteDance in 2019 had laid out plans to invest $1 billion in India. At the time of last year's ban, the Indian government described the apps as prejudicial to the "sovereignty and integrity of India". The move followed a skirmish with Chinese troops. In the United States, the previous Trump administration ordered ByteDance to divest TikTok citing national security concerns, and sought to impose restrictions that would have effectively barred its use. TikTok has also come under scrutiny in Australia for any risks it may pose to users from around potential foreign interference and data privacy issues.

The 30-share BSE index plunged 938 points or 1.94 per cent to finish at 47,410; while the broader NSE Nifty settled 271 points or 1.91 per cent lower at 13,968.

While Tech Mahindra, ITC, PowerGrid and Ultra Cemco were the top gainers rising up to 2.57 per cent. Shares of Reliance Industries slipped as much as 2.29% to an over one-month low of Rs 1,895 after US e-commerce giant Amazon sought to block Future Group's $3.4 billion retail asset sale to the conglomerate, making it the top drag on Nifty. Amazon requested an Indian court to enforce a Singapore arbitrator's order that Reliance's deal with the Future Group be put on hold, Reuters reported on Monday. Amazon moves Delhi HC to enforce Singapore order and block Reliance-Future dealFuture Retail's shares fell 5% on the news, after Amazon.com also called for Future Group's chief executive officer to be detained.

Analysts also said that investors have preferred taking profits off the table ahead of the Union Budget and F&O expiry. Adding to the pressure, Asian shares also slipped as investors looked to the Federal Reserve's guidance on monetary policy.

NEW DELHI: With International Monetary Fund (IMF) projecting that India will reclaim the status of world's fastest-growing economy and projected its growth at 11.5 per cent in 2021, experts on Wednesday said that India is rebounding to achieve the target of a $5 trillion economy. Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal termed the IMF projections for India as "Bright star in the global economy." "Bright Star in Global Economy: India to continue its growth story at rapid pace under PM @NarendraModi ji, with @IMFNews projecting an impressive 11.5% growth rate for India in 2021. It makes India only major economy to register double-digit growth in 2021," Goyal tweeted. Charan Singh, CEO, EGROW Foundation and former RBI chair professor said, "As was expected, and I had been arguing that India's fundamentals are strong, IMF, in its latest release has projected India's growth at 11.5 per cent in 2021 and 6.8 per cent in 2022. This is the highest growth rate to be recorded by any country." Singh said that IMF observed that the substantial revision in India's growth projection is because of stronger than expected recovery after lockdown. "Hence, India has saved the lives of people in lockdown, and now galloping to recoup growth trajectory. This has been due to the well-calibrated, adequately sequenced policies of the Government. Thus, a V-shaped recovery is on the way, and India is rebounding, to achieve a $5 Trillion Economy, despite the Covid set-back," he added. DK Mishra, a market expert, said that Covid-19 pandemic has impacted worldwide economies in a big way but Indian economy has come out of initial hits due to measures taken by government and strong consumer demands. "The same is evident from strong GST collections and good agricultural growth. The projection for 11.50 per cent growth by IMF in GDP is yet another confirmation of the strong recovery of the economy. The future outlook with the Covid vaccine in the market will be good for our economy," he said. In its latest World Economic Outlook update released on Tuesday, the IMF predicted that India's gross domestic product (GDP) will grow at the pace of 11.5 per cent in 2021. IMF projections show that India's economy will grow much better than China which is predicted to grow at 8.1 per cent, followed by Spain (5.9 per cent), France (5.5 per cent) and United States (5.1 per cent).

NEW DELHI: With work from home becoming the new normal, it is going to be difficult for the finance minister to separate salary from business income. Raising the standard deduction for salaried employees may help level the field.Two years ago, in July 2019, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented her maiden budget -- and the first Budget of the second term of the NDA government. In that Budget, she hiked the standard deduction for salaried employees to Rs 50,000 from Rs 40,000. Union Budget 2021-22: Complete coverageThe standard deduction is an amount that is deducted from an individualâs salaried taxable income, thus reducing the taxable income. Clearly, if the government wants to put more money in the hands of the taxpayer (as it may need to in order to boost demand that has been choked by Covid-related lockdowns), a substantial increase in the standard deduction makes sense. Except that the finance minister, in the Budget presented in February 2020, had eliminated the standard deduction for taxpayers who opted to enter a new tax regime where lower tax slabs were offered to those who forgo the standard deduction and a host of other exemptions. These tax slabs are 5 to 10 percentage points lower than the older slabs -- at the lower end of the income scale. At the higher end (income of Rs 15 lakh plus), the tax rate remains the same. Tax mavens have discussed the new scheme at length, and see it as the governmentâs first, exploratory move into a no-exemption regime. Is this fair to salaried employees? In an article written in June 2019 by EY, it was made clear that income-tax rules seem skewed against salaried employees. While businesspeople and consultants can claim exemptions against all kinds of expenses every month, salaried employees have far fewer options. Tax is deducted at source by the employer, significantly reducing take-home pay. New, or old: Which tax regime makes the most sense for you?EY also offered a hypothetical case of a salaried employee and a consultant. Both make the same gross income of Rs 30 lakh, one as salary and one as fees. Post tax, however, the story is vastly different. The salaried employee pays Rs 6.73 lakh in taxes. The consultant, meanwhile, pays Rs 2.18 lakh. The salaried employee takes home Rs 4.55 lakh less than the consultant. The finance ministry disagreed with this reading. In a written response, the ministry said: âThe tax paid on taxable salary income and on gross amount of professional receipts cannot be compared as the taxable income in case of professionals is computed after allowing all the expenses incurred for carrying-out the profession. These expenses include rent for office space, salaries & wages of employees, electricity expenses for the office, printing & stationery etc. However, in respect of a salaried individual, there is no requirement to maintain any office and the office expenses are borne by the employer. The only major expenses required to be incurred by a salaried individual for earning salary income is the expense incurred for commuting to the office. For this purpose and other miscellaneous petty expenses which a salaried individual might have to incur, a standard deduction is allowed to the salaried taxpayer which is currently Rs. 50,000.â The purpose of the EY piece was not to question the expenses legitimately allowed to professionals. Rather, it was to highlight the fact that salaried employees had very few options to claim equally legitimate expenses. Now more than ever, people are working from home and are using computers and phones for official work. But they are not allowed to claim even a part of what they spend on buying such equipment as deduction from income. Some countries, such as Denmark and South Korea, allow such deductions to salary earners, and this is something the government could seriously consider now that âwork from homeâ is not just accepted but necessary. Budget 2021: Why finance minister should not bring in any new taxThe few deductions that are allowed to the salaried are unrealistically lower than the actual cost of the services. For instance, the limits for childrenâs education allowance (Rs 100 per month per child, up to two children) and hostel allowance (Rs 300 per month per child, up to two children) were last revised almost two decades ago. The governmentâs claim that standard deduction of Rs 50,000 will take care of incidental expenses rings somewhat hollow. EY said the re-introduced standard deduction subsumed the tax-exempt transport allowance â an annual figure of Rs 19,200 and the medical reimbursement that could be claimed up to Rs 15,000. In short, the end benefit was just an annual incremental net reduction in taxable income of Rs 5,800. Now compare this to what a professional can claim. For starters, thereâs the presumptive tax scheme. Under this, professionals can file their return declaring 50% of their gross returns (subject to gross receipts not exceeding Rs 50 lakh). After the tax-saving investments under Section 80 are accounted for, the professional needs to pay tax only on the balance income. Of course, receipts in excess of Rs 50 lakh will need to be audited and the actual expenses as per the audited accounts are allowed as a deduction. While presumptive tax has really helped smaller and medium-sized professionals, it has resulted in stark disparity between salaried employees and consultants with the same income. The finance ministry disagrees, and says that in the case of presumptive tax, âit is presumed that 50% of his gross receipts are expended towards various expenses required to be incurred for carrying out his profession. However, this is not a standard deduction and it has also been provided in the Act that if the professional incurs expenses less than 50% of the gross receipts, then he has to declare the higher income.â The previous finance minister, the late Arun Jaitley, saw this in a different light. In his 2018-19 budget speech, Jaitley highlighted the fact that an average salary earner pays three times more income tax (Rs 76,306) than a non-salaried taxpayer does (Rs 25,753) â both figures from the budget speech. It will be interesting to see how the finance ministry deals with the issues of presumptive tax and standard deduction in a year when almost the entire country worked out of home. The pandemic-induced lockdown and subsequent restrictions on movement meant that salaried employees and professionals alike spent on office infrastructure at home. This new normal is unlikely to vanish in a hurry. Will the upcoming Budget take this into account when framing the new tax rules? (A version of this article was published in July 2019)

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman faces a huge challenge this year. The coronavirus pandemic raged through 2020, roiling economies and ruining many lives. The governmentâs revenues are down but expenditure commitments are up (think of the free vaccines promised). What path should the finance minister now take? Should she try and balance the books by levying additional taxes? Say, introduce a temporary Covid-19 cess at the highest income-tax slab, or maybe reintroduce the wealth tax? Or, should she focus on maintaining tax stability while stepping up expenditure for economic revival? To understand how both scenarios could play out, letâs first look at what impact moderate tax rates have on the tax-GDP ratio and how this compares with a high-tax regime. EYâs analysis of the historical tax rates in India shows that we have come a long way in achieving the objective of a rational and moderate tax rate regime. For instance, in 1971, the personal tax system had as many as 12 tax brackets, with tax rates ranging from zero to 85%. With surcharge, the highest tax rate worked out to a staggering 93.5%. The effective burden of personal taxes was reduced in successive years as governments recognised that moderate rates, a wider base and higher compliance made for a better tax policy as opposed to high rates. In 1992-93, the tax rates were considerably simplified: only four tax brackets, with the peak rate at 40%. The 1997-98 âDream Budgetâ â presented by P Chidambaram â cut the peak personal income-tax rate from 40% to 30% and the corporate incometax rates from 40% to 35% for domestic firms. This announcement set the new peak tax rate for personal income-tax which continues until today, although with additional surcharges the highest tax burden is now 42.7%. The immediate impact of the Dream Budget was a sharp fall in the tax-GDP ratio. But, soon after, moderate rates led to better compliance. The government also took measures to broaden the tax base. So, eventually, the tax-GDP ratio got much better. Consider the numbers. After the 1997-98 Budget, personal tax collections fell by 6%. However, in the next five years (FY1999 to FY2003), the average personal tax-GDP ratio jumped to 1.4% as against 1.2% in the previous five years (FY1993 to FY1997). A similar effect was observed in the corporate tax collections too, where the average CITGDP ratio increased from 1.4% in the previous five years (FY1993 to FY1997) to 1.6% in the next five years (FY1999 to FY2003). This sustained increase in the tax-GDP ratio was achieved despite India facing global economic headwinds and a three-year growth slowdown between FY2000 and FY2002. The data suggests that stability and a gradual moderation of tax rates resulted in a positive behavioural response with better compliance, leading to an increase in the direct taxes-to-GDP ratio in the long run. Compared to other developing countries, Indiaâs peak individual effective tax rate is still on the higher side (see table above). Indiaâs peak effective tax rate (after including surcharge and cess) hovered between 30% and 35.9% till last year. The hike in surcharge rate by the Finance Act, 2020 catapulted the peak rate to the present level. The prime minister has launched the initiative of âHonouring the Honestâ. In keeping with this spirit, in times of crisis, the focus may need to be on stability, encouraging compliance, broadening the tax base and boosting consumption to improve tax collections. To this effect, certain measures have already been announced and it is expected that Budget 2021 will be constructed around these themes. In the circumstances, any additional burden on existing taxpayers or any new taxes like wealth tax/estate duty, which were discontinued earlier for reasons of high administrative costs and low revenue yield, may not be in sync. The mantra for the FM in Budget 2021 should be âNo New Taxâ. - Anish Thacker & Shalini Mathur(Thacker is tax partner, and Mathur, director, tax & economic policy, EY India (Views expressed are personal)

NEW DELHI: The government is set to amend laws to streamline the functioning, especially the disciplinary aspects, of three professional institutes â the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), Institute of Cost and Works Accountants of India (ICWAI) and Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI). A bill to amend relevant provisions of laws governing the three bodies is expected to be introduced during the second half of the budget session of Parliament. The idea is to step up oversight on the three bodies after a committee suggested several changes almost three years ago. In fact, some of the proposals have been accepted, the legal changes are being undertaken in consultation with the institutes. ICAI itself has been open to changes in recent months and has sought to simplify the process in cases such as those where the Quality Review Board suggests disciplinary action against its members, who are chartered accountants. The disciplinary track record of ICAI had come under the scanner a few years ago, with even Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagging it at the time of the launch of goods and services tax. Subsequently, the role of auditors had come under scrutiny after the collapse of IL&FS and the government had set up the National Financial Reporting Authority to look at important cases. As part of the proposal, the government intends to have a say in the appointment of secretaries of the institutes and directors responsible for discipline of the professionals. At one time, the ministry of corporate affairs, which is piloting the bill, was looking to appoint government officers in these roles. The committee headed by Meenakshi Dutta Ghosh, a former civil servant, had suggested that the disciplinary platform should be independent of the institute, while pointing out that the current mechanism needed to be revamped.

NEW DELHI: India has seen among the fastest revival of domestic air travel globally, with only China ahead of it, after countries started allowing these flights by following Covid protocol. Thanks to this, Airbus says it delivered the highest numbers of aircraft â 57 â to Indian carriers in pandemic 2020, the European aerospace majorâs (India & south Asia) president and MD, RÃ©mi Maillard, has told TOI. âScheduled domestic flights here were suspended for two months from March 25 to May 25. Domestic air travel now back to 60% of pre-Covid level.

NEW DELHI: India has seen among the fastest revival of domestic air travel globally, with only China ahead of it, after countries started allowing these flights by following Covid protocol. Thanks to this, Airbus says it delivered the highest numbers of aircraft â 57 â to Indian carriers in pandemic 2020, the European aerospace majorâs (India & south Asia) president and MD, RÃ©mi Maillard, has told TOI. âScheduled domestic flights here were suspended for two months from March 25 to May 25.

NEW DELHI: The oil ministry is eyeing the InvIT (Infrastructure Investment Trust) route to monetise pipelines worth about Rs 6,000 crore built by Indiaâs largest gas utility GAIL, charting a new course for raising funds for the government as the pandemic spooks bigticket disinvestments such as of Bharat Petroleum. Discussions about InvIT are on in the ministry in parallel to preparations for carving GAILâs countrywide gas pipeline network into a fully-owned subsidiary. The ministry may seek Cabinet approval, although technically the GAIL board can decide to divest stake in pipelines through InvIT. The Dabhol-Bengaluru and the Dahej-Uran-Panvel pipelines will be the first to be monetised. âThere could be gradual dilution, say in tranches of 10-20% stake, to begin with, but GAIL will retain majority stake,â one official said. GAIL will be the second state-run entity to dilute stake in projects through InvIT. The power ministry had in September 2020 secured Cabinet approval for PowerGrid to monetise transmission lines worth Rs 7,146 crore via InvIT. Under the InvIT route, the parent company gets the proceeds and the government makes money through capital gains tax etc. In case of public sector projects, the government, as the owner, can additionally demand higher dividend from the parent. The InvIT route fits well with GAILâs bifurcation, after which the parent will continue to market gas and build pipeline connectivity. The subsidiary will operate the transportation network and continue to raise funds by monetising minority stake in pipelines. The government will retain control of the infrastructure, considered strategic asset, through GAIL and an independent TSO (transport service operator) will manage 25% of the network capacity under the open access policy.

NEW DELHI: The Indian economy is estimated to post a narrower contraction of 8% in the current financial year but is projected to report double-digit expansion next year as well as in 2022-23, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Tuesday. IMF, which released its update to the World Economic Outlook report, projected the Indian economy to grow by 11.5% in 2021-22 and 6.8% in 2022-23 as the economy gathers momentum after arrival of the vaccine and pick-up in economic activity. For the next two years, India is projected to be the fastest growing major economy, displacing China, which is estimated to grow by 8.1% and 5.6% in the next two years. The IMF update forecast a narrower contraction for the Indian economy in 2020-21from the previous estimate of a decline of 10.3%. China is estimated to grow by 2.3% in the current fiscal year, the only major economy to post expansion. IMFâs estimate of contraction for 2020-21 is higher than the 7.7% decline estimated by the countryâs statistics office and 7.5% fall projected by RBI. The Indian economy was hit hard by the strictest lockdown in the world to stem spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. It is estimated to post the sharpest contraction since data began to be published in 1952. Since lifting of the lockdown, the economy has posted a sharp recovery, propped up by pent-up and festival demand. After posting a record contraction of 23.9% in the June quarter, the economy scripted a recovery to post a narrower contraction in the September quarter. Various agencies estimate growth to return in the third and fourth quarters as several sectors of the economy touch pre-Covid levels. IMF said although recent vaccine approvals have raised hopes of a turnaround in the pandemic later this year, renewed waves and new variants of the virus pose concerns for the outlook.

NEW DELHI: The Budget 2021-22 may see the trade-off to become more acute between stimulating growth, and maintaining fiscal rectitude, Kotak Institutional Equities said in a pre-budget note. The Covid-19 pandemic disruptions has pushed down the country GDP growth into the negative zone in two successive quarters and projections are that GDP may contract over 7 per cent in FY21. This contraction has come on the the back of increased spending by the government on Covid relief measures that has already taken up the country's fiscal deficit several notches with expectations that deficit may run at a high of 7.5 per cent of GDP in FY21 as against budget target of 3.5 per cent. "The government needs to aim at increasing stable incomes for large parts of the population in the middle and bottom of the pyramid which have been the worst hit from the pandemic. "We expect the budget to strengthen the Atmanibhar Bharat vision and focus on health, physical infrastructure, and financial sector along with rural India," said Suvodeep Rakshit, Vice President and Senior Economist at Kotak Institutional Equities. The brokerage also expects budget announcements around DFI for infrastructure financing or 'bad' bank to take centrestage as the government aims to finance long term growth. It, however, does not expect expect the government to announce any major changes in taxes though some changes to custom duty, especially on finished/near-finished items could be increased in line with the PLI scheme for select sectors. According to Rakshit there is a need for the government to maintain an easy fiscal. The brokerage expects fiscal deficit of 5.5 per cent of GDP in FY22. "We expect a slightly lower market borrowing to finance the deficit which will maintain the upward pressure on long term rates. We continue to expect the yield curve to flatten given that the pace of policy normalization would weigh more on the shorter end of the curve," the brokerage said.

Budget 2021: Make in India boost, oil cess may be halved

NEW DELHI: The government may give a 'Make in India' push to oil and gas explorers, as it is considering a proposal to almost halve cess on domestic crude oil to encourage exploration activity and allow Covid-hit oil producers to protect their margins. The glut in the oil market and deep suppression of demand during the peak of pandemic in 2020 had pushed down crude oil prices to unprecedented levels. Though crude prices have recovered over the vaccination drive against Covid and a pick in demand coupled with unilateral production cut announced by Saudi Arabia, cess puts domestic crude at a disadvantage against imported oil. Cess on domestic crude is currently levied at the rate of 20 per cent of the value of oil. Official sources said the proposal by the Union oil ministry is to reduce it to 10 per cent. If this is accepted by the finance ministry, the changes may be announced as part of Budget 2021-22 proposals, sources said. Though the larger view is in favour of halving the cess, the exact quantum would be worked out later. The reduction in the levy has huge revenue implications as ONGC alone pays cess in excess of Rs 10,000 crore annually. The changes would also provide a level playing field to domestic companies as imported crude does not attract cess. "Cess is levied only on crude oil produced domestically. Thus, it places domestic crude oil production vis-a-vis imported crude oil at a significant disadvantage as imported crude does not attract such duty. This levy is against the spirit of 'Make in India'," industry chamber FICCI had said in a memorandum given to the finance ministry earlier. "Abolition of the OID (Oil Industry Development) cess for pre-NELP and nomination blocks, reduction in rates of royalty and greater marketing freedom are some measures that will help revive investments and fast-track growth in the sector. Greater support to exploration in the form of faster approvals and self-certification will boost investor sentiment and send a strong message to international investors on the ease of doing business in India and attract further capital," said Sunil Duggal, Group CEO & chief safety officer, Vedanta Ltd. The finance ministry had revised oil cess in the FY17 Union Budget, shifting it from a specific charge of Rs 4,500 per tonne of crude to an ad valorem rate of 20 per cent. This was done to help the exploration firms from higher cess burden at a time when crude oil prices were falling. Though oil prices are moving at over $50 a barrel for some time now, fluctuations in pricing always puts domestic crude producers at a disadvantage. The problem is magnified as cess incurred by producers is not recoverable from refineries and forms part of cost of production of crude oil. The Oil Industry (Development) Act, 1974, provides for collection of cess as a duty of excise on indigenous crude oil. This adds to the loss of revenue for exploration companies. The government is looking to reduce the tax burden on oil companies to push up domestic production that has stagnated for past several years at around 30-35 million tonne. The reduction in oil cess would benefit upstream companies such as ONGC and Cairn India whose production is subjected to the oil industry development cess levied on an ad valorem basis. But under the new open acreage licensing policy (OALP), which provides pricing and marketing freedom to operators along with the power to select the block for exploration, does not attract oil cess. This puts the older oil and gas blocks at a disadvantage to any new hydrocarbon finds. Currently, state-owned ONGC and OIL pay a cess on crude oil they produce from their allotted fields on a nomination basis. Cairn Oil and Gas has to pay the same cess for oil from the Rajasthan block. Most of crude oil produced in India comes from pre-NELP and nomination blocks and is liable for payment of cess. NELP blocks like Reliance Industries' KG-D6 are exempt from payment of cess while pre-NELP discovered blocks like Panna/Mukta and Tapti and Ravva pay a fixed rate of cess of Rs 900 per tonne. The cess was levied at Rs 60 per tonne in July 1974 and subsequently revised from time to time. In 2005-06, when the crude oil prices had increased from an average of $40 per barrel to $60, the OID cess was raised from Rs 1,800 to Rs 2,500 per tonne from March 1, 2006. Again, when the crude prices climbed to over $100, the rate of cess went up to Rs 4,500 ($12 per barrel) with effect from March 17, 2012.

NEW DELHI: The government should increase healthcare spend in the ensuing budget for ramping up the infrastructure in the sector, healthcare service providers have said. "The public spend in healthcare needs to increase from the current 1.2 per cent to at least 2.5 per cent of GDP in the next 3 years, much of which should be invested in creating and modernising our infrastructure. Hopefully, the budget for 2021-22 would take the important first step towards this," Manipal Hospitals MD & CEO Dilip Jose said in a statement. Rapid and proactive actions of the government and the tireless efforts of healthcare workers helped the country navigate the Covid-19 pandemic; however, it exposed the chinks in the healthcare system, and highlighted the need for a major infrastructure revamp, he added. Highlighting the expectations from the budget, Metropolis Healthcare Promoter & MD Ameera Shah said, "The lack of adequate public health infrastructure in India combined with a high Out-of-pocket expenditure imposes a high financial burden on Indian households and therefore increasing the healthcare budget allocation in the coming decade is of utmost importance". The need of the hour is to strengthen the provisioning of healthcare services through public-private partnerships, she added. "While the healthcare segment has been a key focus area and part of country's development plan through various comprehensive initiatives including Swachh Bharat, Ayushman Bharat, National Digital Health Mission and now 'Mission COVID Suraksha', the long-term response to the virus needs a significant part of budget allocation," SRL Diagnostics CEO Anand K said.

NEW DELHI: As the housing market revives from the lows hit last year, developers expect more measures in the upcoming budget to boost demand in the real estate sector. A major demand of the developers has been to remove the ban on subvention scheme for home loans. The National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO) in its recommendations to the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman noted that the ban is not in favour of home buyers as a large proportion of them do not have the capacity to pay both EMIs on their home loans as well as house rents. Industry bodies have also demanded a further widening of the definition of affordable housing. Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Associations of India (CREDAI) has suggested that unit with carpet area as defined under RERA may be redefined as 'that does not exceed 90 square metre in the metros and 120 square metre elsewhere'. Currently, residential units in metro cities with 60 square metres of carpet area and in non-metro cities residential units with 90 square metres of carpet area are considered as affordable housing. Tax reforms sought by the developers include the demand for allowing interest on housing loans to be considered under Income Tax Deduction without any ceiling. The current limit of interest deduction under Section 24 of IT Act 1961 on housing loan of Rs 2 lakh should be removed to incentivise home buyers and spurring overall demand, NAREDCO has recommended. "Also, loss from house property should be fully allowed to be adjusted against other heads of income. In case of unadjusted loss, it should be fully allowed to be carried forward to subsequent years," it said. It has also recommended that Long term Capital Gains from sale of housing property should be taxed at 10 per cent as the provision similar to section 112 for equity shares. Also, period of holding of house property should be reduced to 12 months from existing 24/36 months to qualify the same as Long term Capital asset. CREDAI is of the view that REITs are one way of solving the liquidity problem in real estate and it also offers the investors a choice to diversify their portfolio. It has suggested an extension of exemption under Section 80C to investments in REITs starting with Rs 50,000.

NEW DELHI: The Centre needs to come up with higher budgetary allocation for power distribution infrastructure in the upcoming Union Budget, sector stakeholders and experts said. ICRA has recommended higher budgetary allocation to strengthen the power distribution infrastructure and improve the financial viability of the distribution segment, including the implementation of amendments to the Electricity Act. The government should take measures to augment fund availability and ease land acquisition challenges with a view to achieve the renewable capacity targets, it said. Further, the ratings agency has also suggested support measures to promote investments in the roof-top solar segment. Sector experts have also sought long-term policy measures to promote domestic module manufacturing. Recommendations have also been made to promote investments in transmission infrastructure for harnessing power from renewable projects. Jaideep Mukherji, CEO of Smart Power India, said that as the power sector continues to recover from the pandemic shock, the Union Budget 2021-22 should propose supportive policy measures to address the existing systemic challenges, particularly in the distribution space. "As a major link between the power generation sector and the last-mile consumer, the discoms would require continued government support both in terms of policy action and necessary stimulus packages to build greater financial resilience and operational efficiency in the long run," he said. A healthy distribution sector, in turn, will enhance the quality and reliability of power supply, prompting economic activities, employment generation and social development, especially in rural communities, he said. He was of the view that, as laid out in last year's budget, the focus should also continue to remain on technology adoption such as smart meters to reduce the aggregate technical and commercial losses. "I also believe that corrective measures in processes such as metering, billing, and collection (MBC) will not only improve the overall power demand but will also have a significantly positive impact on discoms revenue generation and profitability," Mukherji said. He also said that budget should take into account the economic contribution of the renewable energy sector and offer necessary support both in terms of relevant policy action and budgetary spend to harness the true potential of the sector.

NEW DELHI: The government in the budget next week is expected to announce measures such as extending the facility of bulk clearance for e-commerce imports and exports with a view to promoting the growth of this fast-growing segment in the country, sources said. They said that as there is a multi-fold increase in the e-commerce sector in the country, a significant volume of products is imported into and exported out of India through this platform and there is a need to find a balance between control and facilitation for the sector. Currently, importers and exporters are required to submit individual/separate clearance documents for each package with the Indian customs department, which adds cost for traders to conduct business through e-commerce. "With an aim to support the growth of the e-commerce sector in India, the facility for bulk clearance of import and export is required for e-commerce import and exports. Additionally, a simplified process in case of return of e-commerce shipments would also help in promoting the growth," one of the sources said. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will unveil the Budget for 2021-22 on February 1. According to exporters, easing of processes for the sector would further help in boosting the country's outbound shipments. "Extending the facility of bulk clearance is a good idea. Globally this facility is there. It will help in reducing transaction cost. If it is permitted, it would hugely benefit the e-commerce trade,' Federation of Indian Export Organisations Director General Ajay Sahai said. A leather exporter said that the move if announced in the Budget would help promote exports through e-commerce medium.

Chennai: Fewer wheels on the road due to lockdowns and postponement of planned hospitalisation resulted in a drop in cashless insurance claims. Some general insurance companies witnessed a 5%-10% YoY decline in cashless settlement of claims â largely health and motor â between April and December, last year.ICICI Lombard saw its cashless claims settlement decrease from 50% in 2019 to 40% in 2020. âWe have seen cashless settlement of health insurance policies decline in this financial year. However, it will slowly revive in the coming months,â Sanjay Datta, who heads its underwriting and claims division said. Bajaj Allianz General Insurance cashless claims settlement has declined by about 5%. âWith the overall health claims predominantly relating to planned hospitalization and surgical procedures, there was a drop as people feared contracting the coronavirus. Since, these procedures are typically cashless claims the percentage dropped by about 5%,â said chief technical officer TA Ramalingam. Since many people left big cities to go to their hometowns, vehicle repairs were undertaken by local garages resulting in fewer cashless claims. Such repairs and claims were paid as reimbursement to the insured. âFrom our analysis, many people have also moved to their hometowns. There is a possibility that some locations may not have our authorized garages for a particular make or model in which case customers opted for a local garage and hence applied for reimbursement claims which further contribute to the reduction in cashless claims,â he added.âInitially, there were few issues in garages reporting shortage of staff due to migration labourers back to their villages. However, it is not a big issue for us currently,â ICICIâs Datta added.

NEW DELHI: Indian and British carriers will continue operating 30 weekly flights till January 30. The government had earlier this year cleared partial resumption of flights to and from the UK from January 8 by allowing Indian carriers to operate 15 weekly flights and a similar permission was given to UK carriers, till January 23. Based on how the situation of the new and more infectious strain of Coronavirus was, the frequency of these flights were to be reassessed. âThe frequency, 15 weekly by Indian and as many by British carriers, remains the same for now. The current approval is up to January 30,â said a senior official. India had suspended flights to and from the UK on December 23, 2020. At that time, 67 flights per week were operated by four airlines â British Airways (29), Air India (23), Virgin Atlantic (8) and Vistara (7) â between London and 10 Indian cities including Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Goa, Amritsar and Kochi under an air bubble agreement. Before December 23, almost 2,000-2,500 passenger used to fly to India daily from the UK on the 67 weekly flights (66 from London Heathrow and one from Birmingham). Flights were allowed to partially resume on January 8, 2021, and to ensure following of stricter Covid testing norms only 30 weekly flights were initially allowed to and from the four metros of Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. The health ministry had issued very strict norms to minimise the chances of the more infectious UK strain from spreading in India.

SAN FRANCISCO: A spat erupted Tuesday between Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk as the tech titans' space firms exchanged barbs over their rival satellite internet projects being evaluated by regulators. Amazon, founded and led by Bezos, put out a statement claiming Musk's rival SpaceX project Starlink was seeking design changes that could "create a more dangerous environment for collisions in space" and also increase radio interference. "Despite what SpaceX posts on Twitter, it is SpaceX's proposed changes that would hamstring competition among satellite systems," Amazon said in a statement, outlining its objections to regulators.

SpaceX has been deploying small satellites to form a global broadband system and is lobbying regulators for permission to move them into lower orbits, which has prompted Amazon's concerns. SpaceX argued in a letter to the Federal Communications Commission that the orbit modifications being sought would not increase chances of interfering with rival satellites. It contended that any claims of such interference were "misleading," and that Amazon was trying to "stifle competition." SpaceX on Sunday launched its Falcon 9 rocket carrying a record number of satellites on board. Scientists have expressed concerns about the number of objects clogging the space around Earth. SpaceX say their satellites are designed to burn up in the atmosphere within a few years. Project Kuiper aims to deliver satellite-based broadband services in the United States, and eventually around the world, and may offer connectivity for wireless carriers and 5G networks.

RIYADH: Saudi Arabia will host a two-day Davos-style investment forum starting Wednesday, with dozens of global policy makers and business tycoons lined up to speak at the partly virtual event amid the coronavirus pandemic. Around 150 speakers will participate in the fourth edition of the Future Investment Initiative (FII), organisers said, seeking to showcase the insular kingdom as a dynamic investment destination. Around 100 speakers will participate virtually from FII hubs in New York, Paris, Beijing and Mumbai and 50 will attend the conference in-person in Riyadh, they added. The participants include Goldman Sachs chief executive David Solomon, Stephen Schwarzman, head of private equity firm Blackstone, American asset management company Blackrock's chief executive Larry Fink and former Olympic sprinter Usain Bolt, organisers said. The summit, earlier slated to be held last October, comes amid the pandemic that has battered the global economy. "There has never been a more important time for leaders, investors and policy makers to come together to work towards re-energising the global economy," Yasir al-Rumayyan, chairman of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, said in a statement. The summit, dubbed "Davos in the desert", was launched by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in 2017 to woo foreign investors and promote his Vision 2030 diversification plan to wean the economy off its dependence on petro-dollars. But the following year, the fallout over journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder by Saudi agents in Istanbul prompted a wave of business and political leaders to pull out of the glitzy conference at the last minute. The murder at Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul triggered one of the top crude exporter's worst ever diplomatic and public relations crises. The conference saw a reboot in 2019 as global outrage over the murder subsided. The forum is billed as an economic coming-out party for the petro-state, seeking to diversify away from oil -- and authorities are eager to project the kingdom's economic ambitions.

LOS ANGELES: Jeff Bezos wants $1.7 million from his girlfriendâs brother to cover legal fees the worldâs second-richest person racked up successfully defending a defamation lawsuit. Lauren Sanchezâs brother, Michael Sanchez, sued Bezos and his security consultant, Gavin de Becker, claiming they defamed him by telling journalists that Michael had been the source of nude photos of Bezos that were leaked to the National Enquirer. The case was thrown out because Michael Sanchezâs only evidence was that he had heard that from journalists. Michael Sanchez betrayed his sister and Bezos by selling their private communications to the tabloid for $200,000 and then doubled down by filing a lawsuit, intended to harass Bezos into a settlement âby threatening discovery and public disclosure of private matters,â Bezos, with a net worth of $193 billion, said in his request filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court. âMr Bezosâs fee request is obscene, even grotesque, on many levels,â Tom Warren, an attorney for Michael Sanchez, said in an email. A California state judge in November threw out Sanchezâs lawsuit under a state law that allows for expedited dismissal of baseless lawsuits over protected speech. Under the anti-Slapp statute, the prevailing defendant is entitled to have legal costs reimbursed by the plaintiff. Bezos went public in 2019 with what he said was an extortion attempt by the National Enquirer. He said it had threatened to publish more details of his relationship with Lauren Sanchez as well as revealing photos if he didnât stop investigating what had prompted a January 2019 expose about their affair while Bezos was still married to MacKenzie Scott. They divorced in 2019. The case is Sanchez v Bezos, 20ST-cv-04212, California Superior Court, Los Angeles County.

SYDNEY: Google is reviving plans to launch its own news website in Australia within weeks, according to a local media outlet contracted to provide articles for the venture, as the search giant fights world-first proposed laws on content payments. The launch of the News Showcase product as early as next month is Google's latest tactic in a high-profile campaign against the Australian government's planned legislation to make the company pay local news providers for content that appears in its search engine. Misha Ketchell, editor of the academic-penned newsite The Conversation, said on Wednesday he was approached by Google "to resume discussions about launching the News Showcase product as soon as possible, potentially in February. We are working with them on this." Google had announced plans to launch News Showcase in Australia last June, signing deals with six small local outlets, including The Conversation, for content. It subsequently delayed the launch, citing regulatory conditions, when Australia's competition regulator published a draft copy of the proposed media bargaining code. The decision to push ahead with the launch was an apparent show of Google's willingness to run its own content deals, negating the need for government-mandated legislation. A spokesman for Alphabet Inc owned Google in Australia declined to comment on Wednesday. Two other local publishers confirmed they had content details in place for the new site, without discussing recent talks. Google Australia Chief Executive Mel Silva told a parliamentary hearing last week the company would pull its flagship search tool from Australia if the laws, the first of their kind in the world, went ahead. Under the planned laws, Google and social media behemoth Facebook Inc must negotiate binding commercial contracts with Australian outlets whose content drives traffic to their platforms. If they can't strike a deal, the government will appoint an arbitrator to do it for them. Google has argued that the legislation, which is currently the subject of a parliamentary inquiry but expected to be passed into law soon, is unworkable. "If Google can demonstrate that it can reach agremeent with some publishers then its aim is to show that that commercial arrangements can be made in the absence of some kind of legislative intervention," said Derek Wilding, a professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Centre for Media Transition. "The question is whether those arrangements are suitable for all publishers. The kind of arrangements that Google can propose will suit some publishers, but not others."

Huge relief for spouses of H-1B workers, Biden nixes Trump plan to kill H-4 work permits

NEW YORK: "Withdrawn". A single word on a thick bureaucratic file on the seventh day of the Biden administration delivered a huge win for spouses of workers on H-1B visas in the US who spent the last four years worried sick that their work authorisations would be killed off. The latest development brings to an end years of effort by the Donald Trump administration to rescind an Obama era regulation that allowed a certain subset of spouses of H-1B visa holders to work in the US. Up until the summer of 2015, H-4 visa holders could not legally hold paid employment in the United States. Almost as soon as Obama changed the game, the lawsuits followed and then the Trump presidency took the attack on the H-4 work permit to a whole new level. On text messages, chat groups and online threads, the outpouring of relief played out online on Tuesday evening. "Great news! Hopefully H4EAD delays will be ending soon which is leading to a long wait for dependent spouses," tweeted Rashi Bhatnagar. Sharmistha Mohapatra posted, "Big win for H4 EAD holders today. Former Pres Trump's EO to rescind H4 EAD is now withdrawn by POTUS. Let's hope excruciating long wait times often resulting in job loss is taken away too!" From the time the skewering of the H-4 work permit (called the EAD) began in Fall 2017, the proposed rule has been published seven times for ongoing review, keeping the H-4 community on cliff-edge. The Trump government justified the move saying it is "economically significant" and aligns with the "Buy American and Hire American" executive order, which was mostly code for keeping foreign workers out of the US and flinging red meat to the Trump base. Now, the backlink to that Trump executive order ends up as a 404 (page not found) error and re-routes to the Biden White House. "Removing H-4 Dependent Spouses from the Class of Aliens Eligible for Employment Authorization" was a Trumpian agenda pursued by White House immigration hawks with intense zeal and inter-agency collaboration. It was being reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), where it was parked for months. The pressure on the H4 community never really let up since Trump took office. The decision to rescind the proposed rule on revoking the H4 work permit came on the same day Biden signed an executive order calling for the practice of racial equity in the United States. Data from the US government show that Indian and Chinese workers account for the lion's share of H-1B visas. H-4 visas typically follow the same trajectory. Indians filed 74 per cent of all H-1B petitions in fiscal year 2019. Chinese filed 11.8 per cent.

SAN FRANCISCO: Microsoft said Tuesday profit rose sharply in the recently ended quarter as the coronavirus pandemic revved a shift to relying on services hosted in the cloud for work, play and socializing. The US technology stalwart reported net income of $15.5 billion in the final three months of last year, a 33 percent jump from the same period in pre-pandemic 2019. Overall revenue rose 17 percent from a year ago to $43.1 billion, Microsoft said in its update for its fiscal second quarter. "What we have witnessed over the past year is the dawn of a second wave of digital transformation sweeping every company and every industry," Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said in an earnings release. "Building their own digital capability is the new currency driving every organization's resilience and growth." Microsoft's commercial cloud offerings took in revenue of $16.7 billion in the quarter, up 34 percent from the same period in the prior year, according to chief financial officer Amy Hood. "We continue to benefit from our investments in strategic, high-growth areas," Hood said. Microsoft shares were up more than five percent in after market trades that followed release of the earnings figures. "These were blow-out numbers that will be another feather in the cap for the tech sector as the cloud growth party is just getting started, in our opinion led by Microsoft," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors. Revenue in Microsoft's consumer-focused More Personal Computing unit was up 14 percent to $15.1 billion, helped by a 40 percent surge in money taken in from content and services at its Xbox video game unit, according to the company. Sales of video games, consoles and accessories hit a record high in the US last year as people hunkered down at home due to the pandemic turned to play. Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's newest Xbox were released in November, vying for holiday season dominance as the pandemic boosts gaming demand.

WASHINGTON: US consumer confidence rose moderately in January while lingering concerns about the Covid-19 pandemic led to a further deterioration in householdsâ perceptions of the labor market, raising the risk of a second straight month of job losses. The Conference Board said on Tuesday its consumer confidence index increased to a reading of 89.3 this month from 87.1 in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index little changed at 89 in January. The slight increase likely reflected the rolling out of vaccines for the coronavirus, which lifted consumersâ near-term expectations. The index was at 132.6 last February. The cut-off date for the survey was January 14. The surveyâs present situation measure, based on consumersâ assessment of current business and labor market conditions, fell to a reading of 84.4 from 87.2 in December. The expectations index based on consumersâ short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions increased to 92.5 from a reading of 87.0 in December. âConsumersâ appraisal of present-day conditions weakened further in January, with Covid-19 still the major suppressor,â said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at The Conference Board. âConsumersâ expectations for the economy and jobs, however, advanced further, suggesting that consumers foresee conditions improving in the not-too-distant future.â More than 25 million people have been infected by the virus, with the death toll over 420,000 since the pandemic started in the United States in early 2020. About 6% of the US population has so far been vaccinated. President Joe Bidenâs new administration has pledged to speed up and simplify the distribution of vaccines. US financial markets were little moved by the data. Near-term labour market outlook dimsThe surveyâs so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondentsâ views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, deteriorated to a reading of -3.2 this month from -1.9 in December. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the labor departmentâs employment report. The economy shed jobs in December for the first time in eight months. The share of consumers expecting an increase in income decreased to 14.4% from 15.7% last month. The proportion anticipating a drop declined to 14.2% from 14.6% in December. Despite uncertainty about the future, the housing market continues to boom. The pandemic has fueled a migration from city centers to suburbs and other lower-density areas as Americans seek more space for home offices and schooling. Demand has also been fueled by record-low mortgage rates. But supply has failed to keep up with buoyant demand, leading to a surge in house prices, which economists and realtors warn could put homeownership out of the reach of many first-time buyers. A separate report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-metro-area house price index jumped 9.1% from a year ago in November after rising 8.0% in October. Robust house price inflation was corroborated by a third report showing the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) house price index surged a seasonally adjusted 11.0% year-on-year in November after increasing 10.3% in October. The FHFAâs index is calculated by using purchase prices of houses financed with mortgages sold to or guaranteed by mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Vaccines will power 5.5% global economic growth in 2021: IMF

WASHINGTON: The spread of Covid-19 vaccines will power a stronger global economic recovery in 2021, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast on Tuesday. After sinking 3.5% in 2020, the worst year since World War II, the global economy will grow 5.5% this year, the 190-country lending organization predicted. The new figure for 2021 is an upgrade from the 5.2% expansion the IMF forecast in October and would mark the fastest year of global growth since the 2010 snapback from the financial crisis. The vaccines should contain the spread of the virus and allow governments around the world to ease lockdowns and encourage a return to normal economic activity. The world economy also got a boost from government stimulus programs late last year in the United States and Japan. But the IMF also says economies worldwide will need support from their governments to offset the damage from the pandemic and warns that coronavirus mutations could cloud the outlook for global health and economic growth. "Much depends on the outcome of this race between a mutating virus and vaccines and the ability of policies to provide effective support until the pandemic ends," IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath said at a press briefing Tuesday. "There remains tremendous uncertainty." In an update to its World Economic Outlook, the IMF said that it expects the US economy -- the world's biggest -- to expand 5.1% this year after collapsing 3.4% in 2020. No. 2 China is expected to record 8.1% growth after eking out a 2.3% increase in 2020. The 19 countries European countries that share the euro currency will collectively register 4.2% growth this year after seeing economic output crater 7.2% in 2020, the IMF says. The Japanese economy is forecast to grow 3.1%, reversing a 5.1% decline in 2020. The IMF gave India a big upgrade, thanks to a faster-than-expected recovery at its factories and farms: The Indian economy is forecast to expand 11.5% in 2021, fastest among major economies, and a turnaround from 2020's decline of 8%. The agency also expects global trade to rebound this year: recording 8.1% growth after falling 9.6% last year.

WASHINGTON: The global economy, ravaged by the Covid-19 pandemic, is projected to grow at 5.5 per cent in 2021 and 4.2 per cent in 2022, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Tuesday, reflecting the expectations of a vaccine-powered strengthening of business activities later in the year and additional policy support in a few large economies. "In our latest World Economic Outlook forecast, we project global growth for 2021 at 5.5 per cent, 0.3 percentage point higher than our October forecast, moderating to 4.2 per cent in 2022,â said Gita Gopinath, chief economist of the IMF. The global economy contracted by an estimated 3.5 per cent in 2020 amidst the unprecedented health crisis. The 2021 forecast is revised up by 0.3 percentage point relative to the previous forecast (5.2 per cent) in October last year, reflecting expectations of a vaccine-powered strengthening of business activities later in the year and additional policy support in a few large economies, the IMF said. According to Gopinath, the upgrade for 2021 reflects the positive effects of the onset of vaccinations in some countries, additional policy support at the end of 2020 in economies such as the United States and Japan and an expected increase in contact intensive activities as the health crisis wanes. However, the positive effects are partially offset by a somewhat worse outlook for the 'very near-term' as measures to contain the spread of the virus dampen activity, she said. Noting that there is a great deal of uncertainty around this forecast, Gopinath said that greater success with vaccinations and therapeutics and additional policy support could improve outcomes, while slow vaccine rollout, virus mutations, and premature withdrawal of policy support could worsen the outcomes. If downside risks were to materialise, a tightening of financial conditions could amplify the downturn at a time when public and corporate debt are at record highs worldwide, she added. The Indian-American economist said the projected recovery in growth this year follows a severe collapse in 2020. Even though the estimated collapse (-3.5 per cent) is somewhat less dire than what the IMF had previously projected (-4.4 per cent), owing to stronger-than-expected growth in the second half of last year, the 2020 economic shrinkage remains the worst peacetime global contraction since the Great Depression (1929-1933). Due to this partial rebound, over 150 economies are expected to have per-capita incomes below their 2019 levels in 2021. That number declines, only modestly, to around 110 economies in 2022. At $22 trillion, the projected cumulative output loss over 2020-2025 relative to the pre-pandemic projected levels remains substantial, she said. The IMF, in its World Economic Outlook (WEO) update, said that consistent with recovery in global activity, global trade volumes are forecast to grow about eight per cent in 2021, before moderating to six per cent in 2022. Services trade is expected to recover slower than merchandise volumes, which is consistent with subdued cross-border tourism and business travel until Covid-19 transmission declines everywhere, it said. According to the WEO, the emerging market and developing economies are projected to trace diverging recovery paths. Considerable differentiation is expected between China â where effective containment measures, a forceful public investment response, and central bank liquidity support have facilitated a strong recovery â and other economies. Oil exporters and tourism-based economies face particularly difficult prospects, considering the expected slow normalisation of cross-border travel and the subdued outlook for oil prices. As noted in the October 2020 WEO, the pandemic is expected to reverse the progress made in poverty reduction across the past two decades. Close to 90 million people are likely to fall below the extreme poverty threshold during 2020â21. Across regions, vulnerabilities, economic structure, and pre-crisis growth trends, together with the severity of the pandemic and the size of the policy response to combat the fallout, shape recovery profiles. Notable revisions to the forecast include the one for India (2.7 percentage points for 2021), reflecting carryover from a stronger-than-expected recovery in 2020 after lockdowns were eased, the IMF said.

WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden has signed an executive order that strengthens the existing Buy American rules by closing loopholes and reducing waivers granted on federal purchases of US-made goods to ensure that American manufacturing is part of the engine of the country's prosperity. Biden, who signed the executive order on Monday, six days after being sworn in, also ordered the creation of a new post at the White House. He said the Director of Made in America at the White House Office of Management and Budget will oversee the all-of-government Made in America initiative. âI don't buy for one second that the vitality of the American manufacturing is a thing of the past. American manufacturing was the arsenal of democracy in World War II, and it must be part of the engine of American prosperity now. That means we are going to use taxpayers' money to rebuild America. We'll buy American products and support American jobs, union jobs,â Biden during an event at the White House event. Biden said the federal government every year spends approximately $600 billion in government procurement to keep the country going safe and secure. He said that there's a law that's been on the books for almost a century now: to make sure that taxpayers' dollars for procurement is spent to support American jobs and American businesses. Biden alleged that the previous administration didn't take it seriously enough and the federal agencies waived the Buy American requirement without much pushback at all. Big corporations and special interests have long fought for loopholes to redirect American taxpayers' dollars to foreign companies where the products are being made. The result: tens of billions of American taxpayers' dollars supporting foreign jobs and foreign industries, he said. In 2018, he said, the Defence Department spent $3 billion on foreign construction contracts, leaving American steel and iron out in the cold. âIt spent nearly $300 million in foreign engines and on vehicles instead of buying American vehicles and engines from American companies, putting Americans to work,â he said as millions of Americans remained unemployed amidst the raging coronavirus pandemic. The executive order signed on Monday aims to tighten the existing Buy American policies, and go further. âWe're setting clear directives and clear explanations. We're going to get to the core issue with a centralised, coordinated effort,â he said. That starts with stopping federal agencies from waiving Buy American requirements with impunity, as has been going on. If an agency wants to issue a waiver to say âWe're not going to buy an American product as part of this project; we're going to buy a foreign product,â they have to come to the White House and explain it, he said. These waivers would be publicly posted. Biden directed the Office of Management and Budget to review waivers to make sure they are only used in very limited circumstances. âFor example, when there's an overwhelming national security, humanitarian, or emergency need here in America. "This hasn't happened before. It will happen now,â he said. Biden said that under the Build Back Better Recovery plan his administration will invest hundreds of billions of dollars in buying American products and materials to modernise infrastructure and competitive strength will increase in a competitive world. That means millions of good-paying jobs, using American-made steel and technology, to rebuild roads, bridges, ports, and to make them more climate resilient, as well as making them able to move faster and cheaper and cleaner to transport American-made goods across the country and around the world, making the US more competitive. âIt also means replenishing our stockpiles to enhance our national security. As this pandemic has made clear, we can never again be in a position where we have to rely on a foreign country that doesn't share our interest in order to protect our people during a national emergency. "We need to make our own protective equipment, essential products and supplies. And we'll work with our allies to make sure they have resilient supply chains as well,â Biden said. Biden said that the executive action will not only require that companies make more of their components in America, but that the value of those components is contributing to the economy, measured by things like a number of American jobs created and/or supported. âAt the same time, we'll be committed to working with our trading partners to modernise international trade rules, including those relating to government procurement, to make sure we can all use our taxpayer dollars to spur investment that promotes growth and resilient supply chains,â Biden said. Shortly after taking office in 2017, Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump issued a series of executive orders that were aimed to strengthen rules requiring federal agencies to buy US-made goods when possible. But critics argued that effort fell short, partly because of Trump's failure to adequately enforce the rules.

NEW DELHI: Google employees from across the globe are forming a union alliance, weeks after more than 200 workers at the search engine giant and other units of parent company Alphabet Inc formed a labor union for US and Canadian offices. Alpha Global was formed in coordination with UNI Global Union, a union federation that represents about 20 million workers globally, and includes unions from countries such as the United States, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, and the UK, UNI Global Union said. "The problems at Alphabet - and created by Alphabet - are not limited to any one country, and must be addressed on a global level," UNI's general secretary Christy Hoffman said. Alphabet was not immediately available to comment.

LONDON: Billionaires including Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Tesla founder Elon Musk have seen their wealth soar during the Covid-19 pandemic while the world's poor face years of hardship, charity Oxfam said on Monday as it demanded steps to tackle inequality. Nations have a "shrinking window of opportunity" to build a fair, green recovery, according to "The Inequality Virus" report, published as global leaders tune in for the World Economic Forum's virtual "Davos Dialogue" meeting. "We stand to witness the greatest rise in inequality since records began," Gabriela Bucher, executive director of Oxfam International, said in a statement as the charity called for higher wealth taxes and stronger protections for workers. "Rigged economies are funnelling wealth to a rich elite who are riding out the pandemic in luxury, while those on the frontline of the pandemic â shop assistants, healthcare workers, and market vendors â are struggling to pay the bills."   COVID-19 has unleashed an economic storm that hit the poor and vulnerable hardest, with women and marginalised workers facing the worst of job losses and the World Bank warning more than 100 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty. It could take more than a decade to reduce the number of people living in poverty back to pre-crisis levels, Oxfam said. Meanwhile, the collective wealth of the world's billionaires rose $3.9 trillion between March and December 2020 to reach $11.95 trillion, the report calculated. The 10 richest men - a list led by Bezos and Musk which also includes LVMH luxury group's CEO Bernard Arnault, Microsoft's Bill Gates and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg - saw their net worth increase by $540 billion in the same period, Oxfam said. That sum would be enough to prevent anyone from falling into poverty as a result of the pandemic and pay for a vaccine for everyone on earth, researchers calculated. The pandemic marks a "pivotal" point which has exposed economic disparities and built support for "transformative" policies, Oxfam said, calling for higher taxes on wealth and corporations alongside stronger protections for workers. A temporary tax on excess profits made by the 32 global corporations that have profited the most during the pandemic could have raised $104 billion in 2020, Oxfam said. International cooperation would be key to implementing many changes, said Jayati Ghosh, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who was among the economists polled by Oxfam for the report. The administration of new U.S. President Joe Biden will spur "more willingness" for joint action on issues including a crackdown on tax havens and a bailout for developing nations, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. "There are some very, very big hurdles, but there are many things that can be done very quickly," she added.

PARIS: The Covid-19 crisis is aggravating inequality, with the richest quickly getting richer while it will likely take years for the world's poorest to recover, anti-poverty group Oxfam said Monday. In a report entitled "The inequality virus", the group warned that the pandemic is the first time since records began that inequality is rising in virtually every country at the same time. "The 1,000 richest people on the planet recouped their Covid-19 losses within just nine months, but it could take more than a decade for the world's poorest to recover," said the Oxfam report. Oxfam also highlighted the fact that the impact of the virus is also being felt unevenly, with ethnic minorities in certain countries dying at higher rates and women being overrepresented in the sectors of the economy that are hardest hit by the pandemic. The report is timed to coincide with the start of the World Economic Forum's virtual Davos event: an entire week of global programming will be dedicated to helping leaders choose innovative and bold solutions to stem the pandemic and drive a robust recovery over the next year. Oxfam argued in its report that fairer economies are the key to a rapid economic recovery from Covid-19. It calculated that a temporary tax on excess profits made by the 32 global corporations that have gained the most during the pandemic could have raised $104 billion in 2020, an amount it said was enough to have provided unemployment benefits for all workers and financial support for all children and elderly people in low- and middle-income countries. "Extreme inequality is not inevitable, but a policy choice," said Gabriela Bucher, executive director of Oxfam International. "The fight against inequality must be at the heart of economic rescue and recovery efforts" with investments in public services financed by a tax system where the richest individuals and corporations pay their fair share.

LONDON: Anti-poverty campaigner Oxfam warned Monday that the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic will lead to the biggest increase in global inequality on record unless governments radically rejig their economies. In a report geared to inform discussions at the World Economic Forum's online panels of political and business leaders this week, Oxfam said the richest 1,000 people have already managed to recoup the losses they recorded in the early days of the pandemic because of the bounce back in stock markets. By contrast, Oxfam said it could take more than a decade for the world's poorest to recover their losses. âRigged economies are funnelling wealth to a rich elite who are riding out the pandemic in luxury, while those on the frontline of the pandemic â shop assistants, healthcare workers, and market vendors â are struggling to pay the bills and put food on the table," said Gabriela Bucher, executive director of Oxfam International. Using figures from Forbes' 2020 Billionaire List, Oxfam said the world's 10 richest people, including the likes of Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Warren Buffett, saw their fortunes increase by half a trillion dollars since the crisis began even though the global economy remains smaller than when the pandemic started a year ago. Meanwhile, using data specially provided by the World Bank, Oxfam said that in a worst-case scenario global poverty levels would be higher in 2030 than they were before the pandemic struck, with 3.4 billion people still living on less than $5.50 a day. Bucher said women and marginalised racial and ethnic groups are bearing the brunt of this crisis and are âmore likely to be pushed into poverty, more likely to go hungry, and more likely to be excluded from healthcare.â While urging governments to ensure that everyone has access to a coronavirus vaccine and financial support if they lose their job, Bucher said policies in a post-coronavirus world should focus on ending poverty and protecting the planet. âThey must invest in public services and low carbon sectors to create millions of new jobs and ensure everyone has access to a decent education, health, and social care, and they must ensure the richest individuals and corporations contribute their fair share of tax to pay for it,â she said. âThese measures must not be band-aid solutions for desperate times but a 'new normal' in economies that work for the benefit of all people, not just the privileged few,â she added. Oxfam has traditionally sought to inspire debate at the World Economic Forum's annual gathering of business and political elites in the Swiss ski resort of Davos. Though the pandemic means there won't be any trek up the mountains this week, organisers are putting on a virtual gathering. Leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa are all set to take part in the meetings from Jan. 25-29. Joining them will be a host of chief executives and campaigning organisations, including Oxfam and the likes of Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.

Xi Jinping to open virtual Davos forum as virus-hit West struggles

PARIS: Chinese President Xi Jinping was on Monday slated to open an all-virtual World Economic Forum, with his country still appearing on track to emerge stronger from the coronavirus pandemic that continues to wreak havoc elsewhere. Monday's schedule echoes the global economic picture, with Xi headlining as European policymakers -- including European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde and French and German economy ministers Bruno Le Maire and Peter Altmaier -- discuss "restoring economic growth". US President Joe Biden will be absent from the week-long online gathering, as he tackles urgent and daunting challenges at home. The January 2020 WEF, which took place in its usual Swiss Alpine resort of Davos, saw the global elite just starting to worry about a pandemic that surfaced in China a month earlier. A year on, the coronavirus is leaving a mounting death toll, upending economies and depriving millions of people of work. And initial optimism about a swift, smooth vaccine rollout ending the pandemic has ebbed in the face of distribution hiccups and new virus variants. But China and Asian countries in 2021 are making a strong comeback from the virus that hit them first. In virtual format because of the pandemic, this week's event is headlined: "A Crucial Year to Rebuild Trust." The big names from Europe will be German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who heads the European Union executive. Biden will not appear at the virtual Davos, which has never been a fixture on the White House calendar -- even if the new administration has pledged to revive a US multilateral foreign policy after four years of Donald Trump's America First approach. Trump had been an exception as he stopped in Davos twice, with the real estate billionaire enjoying mixing with the global business elite. Biden is nevertheless sending John Kerry, the special climate envoy who will be welcomed after the new Democratic president brought Washington back into the Paris climate accord. Showing up from Asia are China's and South Korea's presidents as well as the prime ministers of India and Japan. Following the first virtual session, Davos will move in May to Singapore, far from the luxury Swiss ski resort where it has taken place since it was launched in 1971, the brainchild of German professor Klaus Schwab. The stated reason for the change is health and safety, as the city-state has recorded just 29 Covid-19 deaths. And a virtual forum is not particularly attractive for the world's well-heeled movers and shakers, who value huddles behind closed doors in fancy hotels over meetings in formal settings. But there is also an economic background to the move underscored by French insurance-credit group Euler Hermes, who said in a study this month that the "world's economic centre of gravity" (WECG) has been moving towards Asia since 2002. Booking growth of 2.3 percent last year while other major economies slumped, China is now on course to equal the size of the US economy in 2030, two years earlier than the analysts predicted before the pandemic. "The Covid-19 crisis could accelerate the shifting global balance towards Asia," Euler Hermes said. Xi last addressed Davos in 2017, presenting himself as the champion of free trade, much to the joy of Davos participants who feared the newly-elected Trump's protectionist moves. Elsewhere on the agenda are workshops entitled: "Stakeholder Capitalism: Building the Future" as well as "Advancing a New Social Contract" and "Resetting Consumption for a Sustainable Future." In a column published in mid-January, Schwab said 2021 could be a positive and historic year, 75 years after the original "Year Zero" following the devastation of World War II. "We once again have a chance to rebuild," he said, calling for rethinking capitalism in the light of a pandemic that has worsened inequality. He said "Covid-19 has delivered the final blow" to the post-war model where free markets and limited government produced prosperity and progress that now is "no longer sustainable, environmentally or socially." In a report timed to coincide with the start of the forum, anti-poverty group Oxfam said Monday that inequality is rising in almost every country at the same time, a first since records began. "It could take more than a decade for the world's poorest to recover," Oxfam said in the study titled "The inequality virus".

Samsung chief will not appeal 2.5-year jail term: Lawyer

SEOUL: The de facto chief of South Korea's Samsung business empire will "humbly accept" the court ruling that sentenced him to 2.5 years in prison for corruption and will not appeal, his lawyer said Monday. Lee Jae-yong, vice-chairman of Samsung Electronics, the world's biggest smartphone and memory chip maker, was found guilty of bribery and embezzlement in connection with the scandal that brought down former president Park Geun-hye. The Seoul Central District Court jailed him in a retrial last week, the latest step in a long-running legal process that has hung over Samsung for years. But the decision not to appeal could mean that Samsung is looking to draw a line under the issue: with time already served, Lee will be eligible for parole as soon as September -- as long as prosecutors do not successfully appeal for a longer sentence. "Vice-chairman Lee will humbly accept the ruling and has decided not to appeal," his lawyer Lee In-jae said in a statement. The 52-year-old was first jailed for five years in 2017, after Park's ouster. He walked free the following year when an appeals court dismissed most of his bribery convictions and gave him a suspended sentence, but the Supreme Court later ordered Lee to face a retrial. Given Lee has served around a year in prison he is due for release in July 2022, even without parole, a presidential pardon or a commutation. Samsung is by far the biggest of the family-controlled conglomerates, or chaebols, that dominate business in the world's 12th-largest economy. Its overall turnover is equivalent to a fifth of the national gross domestic product and it is crucial to South Korea's economic health. Experts have warned a prolonged leadership vacuum could hamper its decision-making on future large-scale investments of the kind that have been key to its rise.

Joe Biden, citing 'economic imperative', orders faster relief checks, more food aid

WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden on Friday ordered the faster issuance of pandemic stimulus checks to needy families and increased food aid for children who normally rely on school meals, an effort to ease Americansâ burdens while Congress negotiates over his proposed $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package. In the opening days of his administration, Biden is emphasizing that the government must tackle the coronavirus crisis with urgency after his predecessor Donald Trump largely played it down. More than 400,000 Americans have died from the virus and millions of jobs have been lost. âItâs not just to meet the moral obligation,â Biden said in remarks at a White House event to sign two executive orders. âThis is an economic imperative.â Biden said his stimulus package to address the economic effects of the pandemic has support from business, labor, Wall Street and Main Street. âA lot of America is hurting. The virus is surging. ... Families are going hungry. People are at risk of being evicted. Job losses are mounting again. We need to act. No matter how you look at it, we need to act,â Biden said. Republican lawmakers have questioned the price tag on pandemic aid and a separate investment proposal for infrastructure, green energy projects, education and research. Biden says we need to act 'decisively and boldly'Earlier on Friday, White House National Economic Council director Brian Deese said he would speak with lawmakers on Sunday to push for relief. âWeâre at a precarious moment for the virus and the economy. Without decisive action, we risk falling into a very serious economic hole, even more serious than the crisis we find ourselves in,â Deese said. Bidenâs actions were not a substitute for legislative relief, Deese said, with about 16 million people now receiving some type of unemployment benefit and an estimated 29 million who do not have enough to eat. A major pillar of the Biden plan is greatly increasing the number of people who are being vaccinated against the novel coronavirus. In December, Biden set a goal of 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days in office and on Friday he spoke of exceeding that number. âWeâre going to, God willing, not only do 100 million, weâre going do more than that,â he said. The US Centers for Disease Control said it had administered 19.1 million doses of the vaccine as of Friday. Women, minorities and low-income service workers have been disproportionately hurt, with Black and Hispanic workers facing higher jobless rates than white workers. In an early test of whether Republicans might support Democrat Bidenâs plans for coronavirus relief, infrastructure investment and tax increases, the US Senate Finance Committee voted unanimously on Friday to approve Janet Yellen, Bidenâs choice for Treasury Secretary, paving the way for her confirmation by the full chamber. Bidenâs hopes for speedy action on his legislative agenda and Cabinet appointments are complicated by the expected trial of Trump in the Senate as early as next week and bipartisan squabbling over operations in an evenly split Senate. In an executive order on Friday, Biden asked the Treasury Department to consider taking steps to expand and improve delivery of stimulus checks, such as by establishing online tools for claiming payments. Biden also said that under his executive order he expected the Department of Labor âto guarantee the right to refuse employment that will jeopardize your health, and if you do so youâll still be able to qualify for (unemployment) insurance.â Unemployment benefits are largely administered by the states, which set their own eligibility requirements, and it was unclear how the federal agency would put this directive into effect. Biden is also asking the agriculture department to consider issuing new guidance to increase the aid given to families who normally rely on schools to provide a daily main meal for their children. It could provide a family with three children more than $100 of additional support every two months.

BENGALURU/ NEW DELHI: Around half-a-dozen companies â including Paytm and EtechAces Marketing and Consulting, which houses both PolicyBazaar and PaisaBazaar â are considering an international listing but are awaiting detailed guidelines from the corporate affairs ministry and the revenue department. While legal amendments for a global IPO have been undertaken, guidelines on where they can list as well as the tax regime are yet to be thrashed out and companies are expecting that it will be clearer in the Budget. EtechAces Marketing and Consulting, which has kick-started the internal process for an IPO, is looking at a timeline of around October to be ready for the issue, two persons aware of the matter told TOI. The company, which was last valued at around $1.5 billion, recently saw a Dubai-based fund buying into the company through a secondary share sale, another person confirmed. Last July, SoftBank had picked up an additional stake by investing $130 million in a secondary share sale of the company. Paytm too has started internal discussions on the matter, including a potential overseas listing. âThere is no timeline yet for the Paytm IPO. But it is definitely working on the path and is tracking changes in listing rules closely,â a person aware of the companyâs plans said. Paytm is the most valued Indian startup at $16 billion since it closed a $1 billion fund-raise in 2019. SoftBankâs Vision Fund is an investor in both Paytm and EtechAces. When contacted, Policy-Bazaar co-founder and director Alok Bansal said the company is inclined towards a domestic IPO but it will take the final call, whether to list in India or abroad, based on final listing guidelines, by this financial year. Though the company has been carrying out small-sized secondary transactions, it is expected to go for sizeable pre-IPO fund-raise this year. A Paytm spokesperson declined to comment. Over the next two years, multiple local startups are expected to launch their IPOs including the likes of online food delivery platform Zomato, logistics firm Delhivery, and online beauty store Nykaa. This would pave the way for these firms to provide an exit to venture capital funds, who have invested in these startups over the years. The corporate affairs ministry has identified seven to eight international markets where Indian companies could list, including the US, the UK and Japan, apart from GIFT City in Gujarat.

BENGALURU: The newly formed Indian alliance, Atamnirbhar Digital India Foundation (ADIF), has written to the government, saying it should conduct a data audit of WhatsApp and its parent firm, the social media giant, on user data flowing outside India. ADIF was formed to fight BigTech firms like Facebook and Google. It is an internet body thatâs been set up by local entrepreneurs and investors to create a level playing field for Indian startups. It also aims to work with the government on regulatory and legal aspects of policy making in light of increased competition from major US firms. âGovernment may conduct an audit through CERT-In (government agency) to check any sharing of data of individual or business users with Facebook and its subsidiaries. Since WhatsApp proposes to share business interaction details of Indian customers with its group companies like Facebook, WhatsApp should be prohibited from offering any services which deal with personal sensitive data of Indian users,â the note sent to IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, and reviewed by TOI, said. ADIF secretary general Ajay Data confirmed the same to TOI. Despite multiple clarifications from WhatsApp on its privacy policy changes, it continues to draw scrutiny from many quarters. ADIF has also highlighted that the government should ensure WhatsApp continues treating Indian users and businesses on a par with global markets even as the government has asked it to withdraw the proposed policy changes. âWhatsApp has rolled out separate privacy and data sharing policies for Europe and India wherein the protections offered to EU citizens are far greater than those offered to Indian users. In fact, WhatsApp does not share data of its European Union users with Facebook for the purpose of improving its products or advertisements. This raises questions as to WhatsAppâs intentions,â the note said.

BENGALURU: Salesforce has made its first investment in India. Its venture arm, Salesforce Ventures, which has backed firms like Zoom, has led a $15 million financing in HR-tech startup Darwinbox. The five-year-old startup helps organisations manage digitally their human resources needs, including hiring, on-boarding, touchless attendance, and employee management. The company has seen a three times jump in revenue in the last 12-15 months, Darwinbox co-founder Chaitanya Peddi said. The growth was aided by the pandemic induced demand for digital solutions. Salesforceâs backing will help the Hyderabad-based firm to expand in new markets. It will also tap into the expertise of the US cloud solutions major for building new products. Peddi will also work with Salesforce India chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya to build partnerships and address market opportunities. Existing investors Sequoia Capital India, Lightspeed India, Endiya Partners, and 3one4 Capital have also participated in this round. The company has now raised a total of $35 million. âWhat would have taken three years, has taken three months (cloud adoption). Last quarter was our highest (by revenue and clients). We have added 300 clients in the last one year to take the total to 500,â Peddi said. In India, it works with a range of companies including Grofers, Myntra, Mahindra Group, TVS Group and Adani Group. It started expanding into South East Asia last year. âWe will focus on emerging markets - Middle East, Nigeria,â Peddi said. âCloud adoption in Asia is growing at a monumental pace and the pandemic has only further amplified the importance of going digital,â said Alex Kayyal, partner and head of international, Salesforce Ventures.

BERLIN: Human resources software company Personio said on Monday it had raised $125 million from investors at a valuation of $1.7 billion, becoming the second German technology startup to claim a 'unicorn' valuation already this year. Personio follows freight tech startup Sennder in achieving a valuation of more than $1 billion. The Munich-based company, which serves small- and mid-sized companies, last raised funds at a valuation of $500 million just 12 months ago. European software startups are drawing abundant backing from venture capital funds including Index Ventures, the lead investor in Personio's Series D funding round, despite broader business headwinds from the coronavirus pandemic. âWhile the past year has proven difficult for many industries and businesses, it has at the same time accelerated the digitization of small and mid-sized businesses," said Hanno Renner, Personio's co-founder and CEO. The company's all-in-one HR platform, which covers human resources, recruiting and payroll, is priced on a per-employee basis, making it possible for small companies to avoid up-front costs and to pay as they grow. Revenues doubled last year and Personio now serves 3,000 companies. In addition to its core German-speaking markets, the company has expanded into Spain, Britain, the Nordic region and Benelux and will enter France and Italy this year. Existing investors Accel, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Northzone, Global Founders Capital and Picus participated in the funding round. Meritech invested in Personio for the first time.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday launched a Rs 1,000 crore seed fund for the start-up sector assuring there would be no shortage of funds for the sector and said the Centre will help them raise equity through guarantees. âThis will help in starting and growing new start-ups. Fund of funds scheme is already helping start-ups raise equity capital. India is working for a start-up ecosystem based on the mantra âOf the Youth, By the Youth, For the Youthâ, We have to fix our goals for the next five years and these goals should be that our start-ups, our unicorns should emerge as global giants and lead in the futuristic technologies,â Modi told the virtual Start-Up India International Summit. The PM also said future technologies and entrepreneurs should come together in Asia as it is also the century of Asia. He urged Asian countries to join hands, collaborate and take responsibility for leading this effort. Modi said the biggest USP of the start-up world is its disruption and diversification capacity. âThe greatest feature of this ecosystem is that it is guided more by passion than pragmatism. This âcan-doâ spirit is evident in the way India is working today,â he said. He cited the example of BHIM UPI which has revolutionised the payment system and in December last year, 4 lakh crore worth of transactions took place through UPI in the country. Similarly India is leading in solar and AI sector. The PM said the start-ups are changing the demographic characteristics of businesses. Citing data, he said that 44% recognised start-ups have women directors and number of women working in these start-ups is high. He said every state is supporting and incubating start-ups as per local possibilities and 80% of districts of the country are now part of the Start-Up India mission. Youth from all types of background are able to realise their potential in this ecosystem. The PM said this helped change mindsets and attitudes. âFrom âWhy donât you do a job? Why a start-up?â to âJob is alright, but why not create your own start-up!â. In 2014, only 4 Indian start-ups were in the âunicorn clubâ now, more than 30 start-ups have crossed the $1 billion mark,â he said.

BENGALURU: A group of Indian startups and investors have joined forces to form a new alliance -- Atmanirbhar Digital India Foundation (ADIF) -- to break the dominance of foreign internet giants like Google and Facebook. This body hopes to also advise the government and sector regulators on legal and policy frameworks needed to further grow the digital economy. ADIF's formation comes following the furore over Google's billing policy in India, which demanded a 30% share of in-app purchase amounts. While Google delayed the implementation of the policy in India, it led to local internet firms joining forces against the BigTech firms. The billing issue reached the government and competition regulator CCI opened a probe against the billing policy and its alleged partial treatment of its payments unit Google Pay. The probe is under way. ADIF has been set up as a Trust that will work for Indian companies for a level playing field and its members currently include venture firm India Quotient founding partner Anand Lunia, Murugavel Janakiraman of Matrimony, Ritesh Mallik, founder of Innov8 Coworking, Sairee Chahal of Sheroes, among others. Founders of large desi internet firms are expected to join the group, a member of the new alliance said. TOI had reported about this development in October last year. âThe idea is to get the process started. We will focus on Indian startups that are run by Indian founders. For example, a fully foriegn domiciled firm with no real Indian involved in decision making wonât be part of this. We are finalising these definitions. Member onboarding will start now and there will be elections to appoint formal positions in the Trust," one of the members said. Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma is not yet part of the alliance, at least formally. During the Google billing controversy, Sharma was one of the fiercest critics. Just before that, Googleâs app store had taken down Paytm and its gaming app temporarily citing policy violations. This had kicked off a storm between the two companies. ADIF plans to open chapters in the top 25 cities over the coming few months and later expand membership further in smaller towns.

BENGALURU/MUMBAI: As the furore over changes in WhatsAppâs privacy policy grows, a wide range of companies have started mandating migration to messaging platform Signal. These include new-age tech startups, older corporates and their senior leadership teams who are now using Signal for day-to-day work chats and sharing of internal documents. Paytm and PhonePe, both of which are threatened by WhatsAppâs recent entry into payments, used the controversy to encourage their teams to shift out of WhatsApp. Naveen Jindal-led Jindal Steel & Power is moving out too. Anand Mahindra, chairman of Mahindra Group, has just installed Signal. Tata Group chairman N Chandrasekaran has been using Signal for some time with several of the groupâs senior leadership also using the same platform. Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma told TOI he has asked everyone in his team to move from WhatsApp for work communications. âIt is clear that we will move off formally from WhatsApp,â Sharma told TOI. PhonePe co-founder Sameer Nigam has moved around half of his team to Signal, along with his office groups, according to a series of tweets from him on Monday. In response to a tweet from serial entrepreneur and Cred founder Kunal Shah that network effects are like religion and most people like to stay in what they were born in, Nigam tweeted, âThis time is diff (different). Product wise, Signal has arrived! Moved 1000+ @PhonePe-rs to Signal. Recreated all my work groups. Moved my family groups. Seamlessly. Zero switching cost,â he said. @kunalb11 This time is diff.

Since Gmail is the companyâs official platform, there is a thought to make Google Chat/Meet the official channel for communication. The challenge at manufacturing units would be to integrate everyone at the level of frontline workers and those who may not have email accounts.â WhatsAppâs privacy changes, which include sharing of certain data sets with Facebook, will be effective from next month. The controversy comes at a time when WhatsAppâs daily downloads have touched its lowest since September 2020, according to data from app tracker Sensor Tower. Even in Silicon Valley, prominent voices have called for a shift out of WhatsApp. Investor and former senior Facebook employee Chamath Palihapitiya tweeted that WhatsApp had just killed its best feature â privacy. âPlease no longer text me on WhatsApp. Download @signalapp,â his tweet said. Starting in Feb, WhatsApp will begin sharing all kinds of data with Facebook. They just killed their best feature -â¦ https://t.co/RGOn0pYrfV— Chamath Palihapitiya (@chamath) 1610293989000Earlier, Teslaâs founder Elon Musk tweeted urging people to use Signal.

India home to 21 unicorns valued at $73.2 billion: Taranjit Singh Sandhu

WASHINGTON: India is currently the third-largest startup ecosystem in the world and is home to 21 unicorns valued at $73.2 billion, India's top envoy in the US has said, as he expressed hope that more than 50 startups might join the unicorn club as early as 2022. âEntrepreneurial activity has picked up in India. In 2020 India was among the top 50 innovative economies," India's Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu said. "Today India is the third-largest, startup ecosystem in the world and is home to 21 unicorns valued at $73.2 billion. By some estimates, more than 50 âsoonicorn' startups might join the unicorn club as early as 2022,â he said. A unicorn is a term to indicate a privately held startup company valued at over $1 billion. Soonicorns are startup companies that are good candidates for late-stage investment and have a good possibility of becoming 'unicorns'. Sandhu was speaking at a mentoring programme for Indian National Startup Awards 2020 finalists that was co-hosted by the Embassy of India, in partnership with Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) on Monday. Sandhu said according to a recent report, Indian startups raised $9.3 billion until mid-December this year. âA little below 2019 but definitely encouraging, considering the current pandemic. It is because people like you were not averse to taking risks and were not deterred by challenges. People like you continued to think out of the box. People like you put all your efforts in creating a better life around you,â he said. Rise of Indian IT companies, large talent pool, increased expendable income of Indian middle class and availability of capital have contributed to the growth of India's startup ecosystem. More recently increased usage of smartphones, access to the internet, and recent reforms to push digital finance have given further impetus. There has also been a significant push from the Government through initiatives like Startup India and Digital India, he said. âIndian startups are steadily evolving into global entities creating business products, and solutions for the global market,â he added. âThe Bay Area- Silicon Valley is the world's topmost innovation hub accounting for, I am told, more than a fifth of global venture capital investment. Its success has been hard to replicate elsewhere even with sizeable investments,â he said, adding that the important ingredient that is often found missing elsewhere is the culture of Silicon Valley. Three cities- Bengaluru, Mumbai and NCR Delhi- have changed the face of modern India and find a place among the famous Global Startup hubs. Cities like Pune, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Kolkata are counted amongst the emerging startup hubs. âWe need to do more to be counted amongst the âsuperstar hubs',â he said. Noting that India and Silicon Valley have a close relationship spanning over many decades, Sandhu said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Silicon Valley in 2016 signified the importance of this entrepreneurial bridge and partnership. Sandhu said that Indian programmers, engineers and entrepreneurs are providing their skills and that too in sizeable numbers to US companies. India is also a leading R&D hub for many of these companies. Many US-based venture firms have been investing in Indian talent and are amongst the largest players in the field. Bay Area- Silicon Valley is also central to growth strategies of many Indian companies bringing innovation to the doorstep of customers with the help of startups, he said. âIn the US, startup ecosystem is developing beyond Silicon Valley and big economic centres like New York, Boston, LA, Chicago. Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, Research Triangle in North Carolina, Portland, Minneapolis, are gaining prominence, as emerging start-up hubs. This has opened up new opportunities for collaboration for Indian entrepreneurs,â Sandhu said. Around 150 Indian startups attended the event, said the Indian Embassy in a statement.

Sandhu said that Indian programmers, engineers and entrepreneurs are providing their skills and that too in sizeable numbers to US companies. India is also a leading R&D hub for many of these companies. Many US-based venture firms have been investing in Indian talent and are amongst the largest players in the field. Bay Area- Silicon Valley is also central to growth strategies of many Indian companies bringing innovation to the doorstep of customers with the help of startups, he said. âIn the US, startup ecosystem is developing beyond Silicon Valley and big economic centres like New York, Boston, LA, Chicago. Philadelphia in Pennsylvania, Research Triangle in North Carolina, Portland, Minneapolis, are gaining prominence, as emerging start-up hubs. This has opened up new opportunities for collaboration for Indian entrepreneurs,â Sandhu said. Around 150 Indian startups attended the event, said the Indian Embassy in a statement.

BENGALURU: Serial entrepreneur Kunal Shahâs two-year-old startup Cred has been valued at $806 million in a new round of funding of $81 million led by existing investor DST Global. DST Global has backed major internet startups like Swiggy, Ola, Udaan, Byjuâs and most recently Cars24. Cred, which offers rewards for credit card payments, has also exercised an employee share buyback programme worth over $1 million for its current and former staff, creating one of the fastest such staff share liquidity programmes. Credâs other existing investors like Sequoia Capital, Ribbit Capital, Tiger Global, and General Catalyst have also participated in this financing, which will be used to fuel growth. Shah said the company has managed to double its size during the pandemic and now has nearly 6 million members who use the platform to pay credit card bills. It focuses on a premium set of users. Applicants must have a minimum credit score of 750 to be a member. While it started as a credit card payments app, over the last six months it has launched new products that are said to be seeing strong traction. It has forayed into lending and rent payments. It also has Cred Pay, where merchants can sign up so users can pay them through Cred Pay. Some 1,400 merchants are on the platform. Shah said the majority of the new capital will be focused on user growth. âWe had a very clear strategy to delay monetisation and focus on user growth. We believe we are a perfect platform for merchants, and banking and financial services players to cross sell their products,â he said. On the employee share buyback, Shah said even at its current valuation, 10% of the company is allocated to the employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). âWe hope to maintain this in the subsequent rounds of funding. The idea is to create a serious wealth creation opportunity for the team,â he said. Cred has seen credit card spends surpassing pre-Covid-19 level. This is also attributed to its users being affluent, people who have faced relatively less impact on their incomes due to the virus outbreak. âTheir consumption just shifted in different directions,â Shah said. Shah previously founded e-wallet Freecharge, which was sold to e-tailer Snapdeal for $400 million in 2015 in what was one of the largest M&As in the internet sector then.

NEW DELHI: The government is set to amend laws to streamline the functioning, especially the disciplinary aspects, of three professional institutes â the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), Institute of Cost and Works Accountants of India (ICWAI) and Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI). A bill to amend relevant provisions of laws governing the three bodies is expected to be introduced during the second half of the budget session of Parliament. The idea is to step up oversight on the three bodies after a committee suggested several changes almost three years ago. In fact, some of the proposals have been accepted, the legal changes are being undertaken in consultation with the institutes. ICAI itself has been open to changes in recent months and has sought to simplify the process in cases such as those where the Quality Review Board suggests disciplinary action against its members, who are chartered accountants. The disciplinary track record of ICAI had come under the scanner a few years ago, with even Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagging it at the time of the launch of goods and services tax. Subsequently, the role of auditors had come under scrutiny after the collapse of IL&FS and the government had set up the National Financial Reporting Authority to look at important cases. As part of the proposal, the government intends to have a say in the appointment of secretaries of the institutes and directors responsible for discipline of the professionals. At one time, the ministry of corporate affairs, which is piloting the bill, was looking to appoint government officers in these roles. The committee headed by Meenakshi Dutta Ghosh, a former civil servant, had suggested that the disciplinary platform should be independent of the institute, while pointing out that the current mechanism needed to be revamped.

BENGALURU: TCS has once again become the most valued IT company globally with a market capitalisation of $169.3 billion, moving past Accenture. TCS has been helped by a strong rally in IT shares on the back of better than expected third quarter results. Accenture, which was down 1.6% in morning trade on Monday on the NYSE, was valued at $165.7 billion. Before this, TCS went past Accenture twice â once in 2018, and again in October last year. IBMâs market cap stands at about $105 billion, Infosysâs at $77 billion, Cognizantâs at $42 billion, and Wiproâs at $33 billion. The software companies, however, command a far higher valuation, with Microsoft at $1.7 trillion, Oracle at $177 billion, and SAP at $156 billion.

NEW DELHI: A group of ministers, chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh, is learnt to have deferred merger of public sector telecom firms BSNL and MTNL due to financial reasons, according to government sources. The group of ministers (GoM) has also approved the sale of 6,000 square metres of BSNL land in Noida to Central Board of Secondary Education at the rate of over Rs 1 lakh per square metre. The Cabinet had approved Rs 69,000 crore revival package for loss-making telecom firms BSNL and MTNL, which included approval to merge both the companies. "GoM had deferred merger of MTNL and BSNL, mainly due to high debt on MTNL," according to an official source. As per the audited financial results for the year ending March 31, 2020, the total liabilities of BSNL and MTNL were Rs 87,618 crore and Rs 30,242 crore, respectively. The department of telecom (DoT) has given licence to BSNL to operate in Mumbai and Delhi telecom circle where MTNL is already operating. Besides debt, there are issues around salary structure between BSNL and MTNL employees and bringing them on par with each other is a challenge. While the GoM has deferred the merger of telecom PSUs, it has approved the allocation of 4G spectrum to BSNL in Delhi and Mumbai in place of MTNL. In the case of asset monetisation of BSNL and MTNL, the GoM will take a call on asset sale with a value of more than Rs 10 crore but less than Rs 100 crore. "Dipam mechanism will be used for the sale of any asset above Rs 100 crore. "The GoM has approved a proposal for sale of BSNL property in Noida Sector 33 measuring around 6,000 square metres to CBSE at the circle rate of Rs 1,07,500 per square metre," the official source said.

BENGALURU: Amazon has intensified its legal battle against Future Group and its promoter -Kishore Biyani-with a new case in the Delhi high court to enforce the Singapore arbitration ruling in India, which had stayed the Rs 24,731 crore Reliance-Future deal. The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in October granted an interim relief to Amazon by asking Future to put on hold its merger with Reliance. Amazon's petition in the court, reviewed by TOI, said Biyani-led Future Group 'deliberately and maliciously' disobeyed the international arbitration ruling from SIAC. The filing showed it also sought detention of Biyani in a âcivil prisonâ and attaching his assets to the case. In its bid to block the completion of Reliance-Future deal, the petition has sought an injunction from the court to direct Future Group from taking any steps to complete the disputed transaction with any entities that are part of the Reliance Group. This includes any 'direct or indirect transferâ of Future Group assets to Reliance, according to Amazonâs plea to the court. Future Retail, in a filing to the BSE on Monday evening, said Amazonâs lawyers have informed the company of the case and it will defend the case. An Amazon India spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. Amazonâs latest move underscores the importance of the Indian market where it is fighting a bigger battle with Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, who is scaling up the new commerce venture with JioMart. The global e-commerce major has also sought directions from the court to restrict Future Group from relying on any regulatory or local agency approval to go ahead with the merger. Last week, market regulator Sebi gave a conditional nod to the Reliance-Future deal while antitrust regulator Competition Commission of India (CCI) gave its approval in November. Prior to this, Future in its case against Amazon had asked the court to restrict the latter from âinterferingâ in the deal completion process by writing to the regulators. The court did not grant this to Future among its other observations. Separately, Amazon has filed an application to review this ruling from the court as well.

NEW DELHI: With International Monetary Fund (IMF) projecting that India will reclaim the status of world's fastest-growing economy and projected its growth at 11.5 per cent in 2021, experts on Wednesday said that India is rebounding to achieve the target of a $5 trillion economy. Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal termed the IMF projections for India as "Bright star in the global economy." "Bright Star in Global Economy: India to continue its growth story at rapid pace under PM @NarendraModi ji, with @IMFNews projecting an impressive 11.5% growth rate for India in 2021. It makes India only major economy to register double-digit growth in 2021," Goyal tweeted. Charan Singh, CEO, EGROW Foundation and former RBI chair professor said, "As was expected, and I had been arguing that India's fundamentals are strong, IMF, in its latest release has projected India's growth at 11.5 per cent in 2021 and 6.8 per cent in 2022. This is the highest growth rate to be recorded by any country." Singh said that IMF observed that the substantial revision in India's growth projection is because of stronger than expected recovery after lockdown. "Hence, India has saved the lives of people in lockdown, and now galloping to recoup growth trajectory. This has been due to the well-calibrated, adequately sequenced policies of the Government. Thus, a V-shaped recovery is on the way, and India is rebounding, to achieve a $5 Trillion Economy, despite the Covid set-back," he added. DK Mishra, a market expert, said that Covid-19 pandemic has impacted worldwide economies in a big way but Indian economy has come out of initial hits due to measures taken by government and strong consumer demands. "The same is evident from strong GST collections and good agricultural growth. The projection for 11.50 per cent growth by IMF in GDP is yet another confirmation of the strong recovery of the economy. The future outlook with the Covid vaccine in the market will be good for our economy," he said. In its latest World Economic Outlook update released on Tuesday, the IMF predicted that India's gross domestic product (GDP) will grow at the pace of 11.5 per cent in 2021. IMF projections show that India's economy will grow much better than China which is predicted to grow at 8.1 per cent, followed by Spain (5.9 per cent), France (5.5 per cent) and United States (5.1 per cent).

WASHINGTON: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday projected an impressive 11.5 per cent growth rate for India in 2021, making the country the only major economy of the world to register a double-digit growth this year amidst the coronavirus pandemic. IMF's growth projections for India in its latest World Economic Outlook Update released on Tuesday reflected a strong rebound in the economy, which is estimated to have contracted by 8 per cent in 2020 due to the pandemic. In its latest update, the IMF projected a 11.5 per cent growth rate for India in 2021. This makes India the only major economy of the world to register a double-digit growth in 2021, it said. China is next with 8.1 per cent growth in 2021 followed by Spain (5.9 per cent) and France (5.5 per cent). Covid-hit global economy projected to grow at 5.5% in 2021: IMFRevising its figures, the IMF said that in 2020, the Indian economy is estimated to have contracted by 8 per cent. China is the only major country which registered a positive growth rate of 2.3 per cent in 2020. India's economy, the IMF said, is projected to grow by 6.8 per cent in 2022 and that of China by 5.6 per cent. With the latest projections, India regains the tag of the fastest developing economies of the world. Early this month, IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva had said that India âactually has taken very decisive action, very decisive steps to deal with the pandemic and to deal with the economic consequences of itâ. India, she said, went for a very dramatic lockdown for a country of this size of population with people clustered so closely together. And then India moved to more targeted restrictions and lockdowns. âWhat we see is that transition, combined with policy support, seems to have worked well. Why? Because if you look at mobility indicators, we are almost where we were before Covid in India, meaning that economic activities have been revitalized quite significantly,â the IMF chief said. Commending the steps being taken by the Indian government on the monetary policy and the fiscal policy side, she said it is actually slightly above the average for emerging markets. âEmerging markets on average have provided six per cent of GDP. In India this is slightly above that. Good for India is that there is still space to do more,â she said, adding that she is impressed by the appetite for structural reforms that India is retaining.

NEW DELHI: India witnessed a 13% rise in foreign direct investment (FDI) to $57 billion in 2020 compared to the previous year. The domestic figure was boosted by investments in the digital economy, while China overtook the US as the largest recipient of FDI globally, according to an UNCTAD report. India and China were the only two countries which saw FDI rising in 2020, while the rest of the world, including developed economies such as the UK and the US, saw sharp declines. This was revealed by the UNCTADâs investment trends monitorâs findings. Indiaâs FDI inflows were propped up by acquisitions in the digital economy. The report said cross-border M&A sales grew 83% to $27 billion, a notable deal being the acquisition of nearly 10% of Jio Platforms by Jaadhu â owned by Facebook â for $5.7 billion. It also said that infrastructure and energy propped up M&A deal values in the country. The Indian economy is staging a sharp recovery after plunging to record levels due to the impact of the strictest lockdown imposed to prevent the spread of the deadly Covid. The report said China became the largest recipient of FDI, attracting an estimated $163 billion in inflows, followed by the US with $134 billion. It said that in relative terms, flows declined most strongly in the UK, Italy, Russia, Germany, Brazil and the US. FDI inflows to China increased by 4% compared to the previous year. The pandemic triggered havoc across global economies and the report said global FDI collapsed in 2020, falling by 42% to an estimated $859 billion from $1.5 trillion in 2019. It said that FDI finished 2020 more than 30% below the trough after the global financial crisis. Flows to developed countries fell drastically by 69% to values last seen 25 years ago. FDI in Asean â an engine of FDI growth throughout the last decade â was down by 31%. UNCTAD said global FDI flows will remain weak in 2021. âThe uncharacteristic immediacy of the FDI reaction to the crisis caused by the pandemic was due to physical lockdowns and other mitigation measures making the implementation of ongoing projects more difficult but the effects of the recession will linger and an FDI recovery is not expected to start before 2022. Investor uncertainty related to further waves of the pandemic and to developments in the global policy environment for investment will also continue to affect FDI,â the report cautioned.

NEW DELHI: The policy to scrap more than 15-year-old vehicles owned by government departments and PSUs is likely to be notified soon and will be implemented from April 1, 2022, the government said on Monday. The road transport, highways and MSMEs minister Nitin Gadkari has approved the policy. "The minister... approved the policy of deregistration and scrapping of vehicles owned by government department and PSU, which are above 15 years in age," the ministry of road transport and highways said in a statement. "It is to be notified, and will come into effect from April 1, 2022," the statement said. On July 26, 2019, the government had proposed amendments to motor vehicle norms to allow scrapping of vehicles older than 15 years in a bid to spur adoption of electrical vehicles. "We have submitted the proposal and I am expecting that we will get approval as early as possible for the scrapping policy," Gadkari had said on January 15. The minister had also said that once the policy is approved, India will become an automobile hub and there will also be reduction in the prices of automobiles. He had said recycled material from old vehicles will help reduce the prices, adding that the automobile industry's turnover, which is Rs 4.5 lakh crore with Rs 1.45 lakh crore exports, will get a boost. Earlier, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that a policy for scrapping of old vehicles "is in the works" and will be announced after ministries concerned "fine tune" it. In May 2016, the government had floated a draft Voluntary Vehicle Fleet Modernisation Programme (V-VMP) that proposed to take 28 million decade-old vehicles off the road.

NEW DELHI: No major economy has grown 8-10 per cent without opening up of market, and India should bring down tariff on industrial goods to 10 per cent, Niti Aayog former vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya said on Monday. Participating in a virtual event organised by the Ananta Aspen Centre, Panagariya also said the government should allow non-financial corporations in the banking sector. "Our average tariff, which was 12 per cent in the case of industrial goods, have gone back to 14 per cent, and it should at least come back to 10 per cent... Without opening of market, no major economies have grown 8-10 per cent," he said. Panagariya, a professor of economics at Columbia University, said India should sign a free-trade agreement (FTA) with the European Union. "We have no issue of agriculture with the European Union (EU) because the EU is not super-competitive in agriculture. We should be willing to open our market for the EU," the eminent economist said. He also reiterated that India should be willing to address the EU concerns. Noting that he is the one-man army fighting against protectionism, Panagariya said, "During the 1991 reforms, India saw lots of opposition." Also speaking at the event, fifteen finance commission chairman N K Singh said there are few countries that have been able to sustain 8-9 per cent growth without significantly high exports. Singh said that on the trade side, after new US President Joe Biden took charge, there is new trade-related opportunities for India to look ahead. Veteran banker Uday Kotak said that bank nationalisation happened in India because of politics, not because of economics. Kotak pitched for privatisation of some public sector banks saying that the banking is now a customer-centric business. He also emphasised that businesses need stable tax and interest rate regimes.

Located in a lush, green locale that is connected to natureâs roots, homes in Pune enjoy the best of both worlds; easy access to the benefits of modern amenities and lifestyle while also providing an unmatched sense of serenity.

BENGALURU: Launches and sales of residential projects almost halved in Bengaluru in the second half of last year compared to the year before, a report from Knight Frank showed, but sequentially the fall was much less suggesting that the worst shock from the pandemic is perhaps behind the sector. Launches dipped to 9,123 units from 12,878 while sales dropped to 11,402 units from 19.851. It was 10,806 and 12,177 units respectively in the first half of the year. "While the pandemic and associated lockdown disturbances have left an impression on 2020 performance of Bengaluru residential market, the city made a meaningful return in Q4 with a 32% QoQ improvement in home sales,â Shantanu Mazumder, senior branch director of Knight Frank in Bengaluru, said. The fourth quarter saw an improvement in sales performance compared to the previous 4-5 months with sales up 32% sequentially. Residential sales have reached 54 % of the pre-COVID level. Due to the pandemic, consumers now want to own bigger and better houses. With consumer preference shifting towards ready to move houses, developers have restrained new project launches in this year and reoriented operational and financial bandwidth towards completion of ongoing projects. The recurring spate of sales compared to launches have affected a gradual decline in the inventory level in the city. On an annual basis, unsold inventory is down 5% to 74,764 housing units as at end of 2020. South Bengaluru saw the highest quantum of homes sold in H2 2020 of 3,860 units followed by east with 3,750 units. South Bengaluru also registered maximum home launches to 3,740 units during the period.

NEW DELHI: As the Indian real estate sector recovered from the lockdown lows during the second half of 2020, the average price of residential properties increased by one per cent during October-December 2020, according to the Magicbricks' latest PropIndex. It showed that while the prices for the much in demand ready-to-move segment remained stable during Q4 of 2020, the under-construction segment prices rose by two per cent, amid the recovery phase. The increase in under construction prices was primarily led by western and southern regions. At the city level, the western region witnessed the most price increments, as prices in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Ahmedabad rose by one per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively, while remaining stable in Pune. In the South, while Bengaluru remained almost stable, Hyderabad and Chennai witnessed quarterly price increments even though YoY price change was still negative by 1-3 per cent. Prices in the Delhi-NCR remained flat in Q42020, with a slight decline in the core markets of Noida and Gurugram. However, it has shown an improvement in affordable locations like Noida Extension, New Gurugram, and Sohna. The property search volumes remained at elevated levels in Q4 2020 at about 30 per cent higher than pre-Covid levels, after touching more than the 50 per cent hike in Q3 2020, as buyers continued to make a beeline because of Covid-led availability of distress deals and festive season discounts. On the supply front, Magicbricks witnessed more than a 25 per cent increase in property listings in Q4, post falling by 10 per cent in Q3 due to improvement in new launches and secondary market listings. Commenting on the PropIndex report, Sudhir Pai, CEO, Magicbricks, said: "With uncertainties around the economy and jobs now stabilising, we are witnessing signs of growth in the real estate sector as well. The economy has also stopped shrinking since October 2020 and now we are seeing a V-shaped recovery in the real estate sector." With impetus from the government in the form of stamp duty cuts in some states and first-home buyer incentives, buyer demand is expected to stay at elevated levels in 2021, he said.

NEW DELHI: Weeks ahead of the spectrum auctions, the telecom industry has said that reserve prices for the airwaves are high and it will be âfinancially challengingâ to ensure a healthy sale. Telecom companies want the government to fix a minimum mandated floor price for voice and internet services, apart from lower taxes and levies to improve their financial position and ensure enthusiastic sale. Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), the body representing companies such as Reliance Jio, Airtel, Vodafone Idea, expressed reservations on the governmentâs spectrum pricing strategy and raised fears that much of the airwaves may remain unsold, like in some of the previous rounds. S P Kochhar, director-general of COAI, said the industry is saddled with heavy debt and is passing through a tough financial situation, and thus requires support from the government through easier charges. âIt (auctions) would be financially challenging. Apart from auctions, the industry also faces major upcoming expenses on infrastructure upgradation like 5G introduction, network expansion, and fiberisation, which is critical for providing future communication services,â Kochhar told TOI. The government will be auctioning spectrum from March 1.

NEW DELHI: Increasing R&D investment to expand technology development capabilities and leveraging Indian IT industry's prowess to serve requirements of Indian and global telecom players can help in moving towards Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India), Trai chairman PD Vaghela said on Tuesday. Speaking at the 15th India Digital Summit, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) chairman PD Vaghela outlined some of the steps that can be taken to make "speedy progress and to make India self reliant" in the telecom space. "We need to increase investment in research and development (R&D), this is very important...To be self reliant in the technology space, which is critical for economic and statistical perspective, we need to transform from consumer to producer of technology," he said. To upgrade and expand technology development capabilities, investments need to be made in the complete ecosystem, including research, innovation, standardisation, product development, testing and certification, he added. This requires a complete overhaul of the existing practices and policies and industry-academia linkages need to be established, he said. "The commercial research innovations standardisation and product development need to be incentivised. Such innovation can also focus on meeting developing countries' requirement in the most effective manner and this will open vast market for such products for India," he added. Vaghela said India's IT industry capability can be leveraged to build, operate and maintain software products that can serve Indian as well as global telecom industry, at a reasonable price. "We all know that the maximum value addition is in the technology development, designing of products and services over the life cycle. Keeping in view India's strength in these areas, global companies have already started to establish their R&D centres in India. India has potential to be a global leader in telecom software development and servicing space," he added. Government and regulators can play a major role in encouraging digital innovation and incentivising the development of digital technology for the benefit of society, he noted. Vaghela said there is a need to push indigenous telecom products in India amid the booming growth in mobile and fixedline broadband as well as rise of Industry 4.0 and digital automation. "India has launched a series of market reforms in the last few years that form the foundation for enhancing India's appeal as a manufacturing base. With the skill base in India that includes telecommunication also and the scale of domestic market and technology orientation, India presents an attractive option for global manufacturers," he added. Highlighting the growing consumption of data, Vaghela said the role of data centres attains equal importance towards becoming self reliant in the digital space. "...While India has taken a major leap in the digital space during the last six seven years, a lot is required to be achieved. And we all have to work together.

NEW DELHI: Telecom firms like Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea on Tuesday participated in pre-bid conference for spectrum auctions, as the telecom department asked telcos to submit written queries regarding the rules and processes by January 15, according to sources. During the pre-bid conference, operators raised queries on aspects such as earnest money deposit and roll-out obligations in the bid document, an industry source said. The department of telecom (DoT) sources said telcos, including Jio, Airtel and Vodafone Idea, attended the pre-bid conference on Tuesday. The department has now asked the operators to send their written queries on the issues raised at the pre-bid conference by January 15. The DoT has already released a notice inviting applications for the spectrum auctions in seven bands -- 700, 800, 900, 1,800, 2,100, 2,300 and 2,500MHz bands, and the bidding is scheduled to begin on March 1. Last month, the Union Cabinet had approved a proposal for the auction of 2,251.25 Megahertz (MHz) of spectrum worth Rs 3.92 lakh crore at the base price. Telecom operators will need to submit their application by February 5 for participation in the auction. BNP Paribas, last week, had said that spectrum auction in India has turned into a buyer's market, and may see "minimal competition" with operators going after airwaves that yield the best value for money instead of focusing on renewing all expiring spectrum. With the countdown now on for spectrum auctions, ICICI Securities had said it expects the final prices across spectrums to be equal to the reserve prices due to significant supply of radiowaves, and likely limited demand for expiring radiowaves.

NEW DELHI: State-owned telcos BSNL and MTNL turned EBITDA positive in the first half of 2020-21, demonstrating a marked improvement in performance within a year of approval of their revival plan, the communications ministry said on Monday. While EBITDA of Bharat Sanchar Nigam (BSNL) rose to Rs 602 crore during the first half of 2020-2021, that of MTNL stood at Rs 276 crore, it said in a release. Both organisations expect to reduce their losses by 50% when compared to 2019-20, it said. Regarding 4G services, the department of telecom (DoT) has made its position clear that core network for 4G will be âtotally made in Indiaâ. BSNL and MTNL are strategic assets, and will provide a big impetus to Indian manufacturers in the field of telecom. BSNL is once again back on the track of profitability, it added. The improvement in performance came on the back of a sharp reduction in wage bill due to Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS).

NEW DELHI: BSNL Employees Union has urged the company's chairman and managing director (CMD) to hold regular interactions with the unions, like his predecessor did, for early revival of the loss-making public sector firm. BSNL CMD PK Purwar, however, said he keeps meeting unions, employees and even individual employee for their suggestions and advice. In a letter to Purwar, seen by PTI, the union said in mid-2016, BSNL management, under the then CMD Anupam Shrivastava showed inclination to involve unions and associations in the management's initiatives "night free calling" and "all India free roaming" where employees went beyond their duty hours to popularise the schemes resulting in increase in company's subscriber base. BSNL is the only company, apart from Jio, that has regularly gained mobile customers. The subscriber market share of BSNL increased to 10.35 per cent in March 2020 from 9.44 per cent in March 2018. The company now has over 11.8 crore mobile customers. BSNL employees Union (BSNL EU) general secretary P Abhimanyu in a letter dated January 7 said unions and associations utilised inputs from the management around various initiatives for motivating the employees to give better performance. "When AUAB (Unions and Associations of BSNL) decided to organise the "Service with A smile" movement, the then CMD BSNL, Anupam Shrivastava ji, was kind enough to get that movement kickstarted through a huge meeting held in the corporate office premises. "However, we regret to say that the coordination between the management on one side and the unions and associations on the other side, has become a story of the past," BSNL EU said. When contacted, Purwar said "I always meet both unions and associations as well as individual employees to seek their valuable suggestions, support and advice." BSNL EU on the other hand said it has insisted BSNL CMD on many occasions and alleged that he has been reluctant to have regular interactions with unions and associations as was done in the past. "Even during this Covid-19 pandemic situation, interactions could have very well been organised with the unions and associations, through video conferencing. Unfortunately, that has not happened. Perhaps, you are under the impression that the unions and associations are there only to raise demands of the employees," the letter said. It added that the management's mindset of viewing the unions and associations "as a headache" should be shed. "We urge upon you to restart the practice of having regular interactions with the unions and associations for the sake of involving employees for the early revival of the company," BSNL EU said. BSNL recorded a loss of Rs 15,500 crore and debt of Rs 21,902 crore in August 2020.

NEW DELHI: The Union Budget is around the corner and given the tough year it has been due to the pandemic, the expectations of the salaried taxpayers are high. The year 2020 was challenging for the salaried class. From salary cuts to coping with additional expenses due to remote working and inability to claim certain exemptions like fuel reimbursements, etc, the salaried class braved it all. Given this, the taxpayers are expecting relief in the form of increase in exemptions/deductions from the government in the upcoming Budget. Last yearâs Budget introduced the new concessional tax regime that offers an individual the option to choose lower tax rates in lieu of forgoing certain tax exemptions and deductions. Some of these benefits include standard deduction, exemption towards house rent allowance, leave travel allowance, house property loss, and deduction towards provident fund contributions and life insurance premiums. Budget 2021: Why finance minister should not bring in any new taxThe new regime, effective from financial year 2020-21, prescribes tax rates ranging from 5% to 30% with the highest tax rate applicable for income above Rs 15 lakh. This option is beneficial in those cases where an individual has fewer exemptions and deductions to be claimed. Individuals with higher income levels and tax-saving investments qualifying for deductions or exemptions may not find the new regime attractive. Evaluation of certain factors will be important for individual taxpayers before deciding whether to continue with the old tax regime or opt for the new tax regime.     Individuals with limited deductions or exemptions would have the advantage of more tax savings by opting for the new tax regime. The level of tax savings would depend on the income levels and every individual would have to undertake a fact-specific evaluation keeping in mind her/his investments. While the new tax regime is beneficial for a select segment of individual taxpayers, there is a need to address the expectations of the other set of individual taxpayers who prefer to invest for securing their future and would like to avail the deductions linked to investments.   The pandemic has resulted in a financial burden on many and, hence, the taxpayers are looking for relaxations like extension of benefit to non-senior citizens (under the current law, senior citizens are allowed deduction of up to Rs 50,000) for medical expenditure under Section 80D, increasing the cap of interest on housing loan, extension of additional benefits available for first-time homebuyers, extending the benefit of the newly introduced LTC cash voucher to the next financial year, additional investment opportunities for availing tax benefits through investment in infrastructure bonds etc. Given the varied profile of taxpayers, there exists a case for coexistence of both the regimes going forward. - Amarpal S Chadha(The author is Tax Partner, EY India.

MUMBAI: The pandemic has caused major change of priorities for urban Indians as far as their savings are concerned. People are saving less for marriages, kidsâ education or for small luxuries like cars and vacations. They are setting aside more for retirement, health and untimely death of the breadwinner. According to an annual survey conducted by Max Life, the awareness and actual purchase of insurance by households has jumped during the last one year. But there is a general feeling of being less secure than before, thanks to the fallout of the pandemic. âThe overall protection quotient has gone up as Indians are more aware of insurance protection. Life insurance ownership has gone up 5 percentage points to 71% (among respondents), but the percentage of respondents feeling secure has come down from 60% to 57%,â said Max Life Insurance CEO Prashant Tripathy. He added that this lower level of security was after a vaccine being available, but was understandable given the pain and hardship caused by the pandemic. The survey brought out that insecurity is higher among millennials as compared to non-millennials. According to Tripathy, this was because they were not as settled in their careers as older people. Besides buying more term insurance than last year, the number of respondents having a critical illness cover doubled too. One of the key findings of the survey is that the self-employed have for the first time overtaken salaried in ownership of term insurance. As against last year when 28% salaried and 26% self-employed owned health covers, this year the ratio was 24% and 31% respectively. Going by geography, North India recorded the highest drop in level of feeling of security. As against 68% respondents who felt secure last year, this year it was only 61%. The West actually saw the feeling of security marginally improve from 53% to 54%.

It is tough times in life that teaches us the most valuable lessons. The same can be said true of investments âCOVID-19 pandemic taught us the importance of having a fixed income portfolio with high quality instruments as part of oneâs core allocation.When it comes to investing in debt mutual funds, people find it difficult to understand the pros and cons of different strategies being offered. Past performance or high yield to maturity (YTMs) are not the ideal ways of selecting and allocating to debt mutual funds. Choosing the right fund should be basis investorâs risk appetite and investment horizon. There is a simple yet effective framework that helps segregate debt mutual funds into different buckets, thereby making it easier for investor to choose. This framework comprises of three distinct buckets: liquidity, core and satellite.Liquidity: This bucket is for very short term parking of surplus or for emergency corpusCore: This bucket ideally should form bulk of investorâs allocation â Funds that focus on high credit quality and low to moderate maturity profileSatellite: This bucket has funds that can take higher risk â either duration risk or credit risk or bothBy following this simple method and focusing on building your core allocation first, we believe that the risk in fixed income investing can be mitigated significantly.An offering in the fixed income space that fits in the Core bucket is IDFC Bond Fund â Short Term Plan. It is an open ended short term debt scheme investing in instruments such that the Macaulay duration of the portfolio is between 1 year and 3 years. The portfolio is mostly a mix of high quality debt and money market instruments. As part of the current strategy, the average portfolio maturity is ordinarily anchored around 2 years.Here is the latest highlight of IDFC Bond Fund â Short Term Plan:Data as on 31st December 2020:Average Maturity: 2.13 yearsModified Duration: 1.86 yearsMacaulay Duration: 1.94 yearsYTM: 4.39%Asset Quality: 100% AAA and equivalent instruments(AAA equivalents include sovereign, money market instruments, and cash and cash equivalents)We believe that IDFC Bond Fund â Short Term Plan is a suitable investment option in these uncertain times given its focus on stability, liquidity and return potential of a high quality portfolio. The fund maintains a constraint on duration risk stance with its average maturity anchored around 2 years currently. The fund also has a constrained credit risk stance with its preference towards high quality instruments. The fund therefore can be an ideal fit in an investorâs core debt allocation and should be looked at for investment with a minimum horizon of 2 years.Disclaimer:MUTUAL FUND INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET RISKS, READ ALL SCHEME RELATED DOCUMENTS CAREFULLY.The Disclosures of opinions/in house views/strategy incorporated herein is provided solely to enhance the transparency about the investment strategy / theme of the Scheme and should not be treated as endorsement of the views / opinions or as an investment advice.

MUMBAI: The Gujarat high court declined to interfere and issue a âwrit of mandamusâ to the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) for further extending the time limits to file the tax audit report and the Income-tax (I-T) returns up to March 31. The All Gujarat Federation of Tax Consultants had filed a writ petition with the high court seeking extension of the filing due dates for the financial year ended March 31, 2020. Ordering extension of the due dates may upset the entire functioning of the government and may lead to undesirable results, the high court stated. However, it added that the CBDT may consider issuing an appropriate circular taking a lenient view as regards the consequences of late filing of tax audit report â relating to penalties prescribed under section 271B of the I-T Act. Consequent to filing of the writ petition, the high court asked the CBDT to look into the matter. Following this, CBDT issued a detailed order on January 11 and stated that in the backdrop of the pandemic, the government had been considerate and had extended the due dates from time to time. For instance, the due date for filing the I-T returns for non-audit cases was extended thrice from the original due date of July 31, 2020 to January 10, 2021. For taxpayers who are required to get their accounts audited, the due date was extended from October 31, 2020 to now stand at February 15, 2021. Tax audit reports could now be filed by January 15, 2021 as opposed to the original due date of August 30, 2020. Backed by statistics, the CBDT also submitted that the number of returns filed for the FY 2019-20 (5.95 crore as of Jan 10) already exceeded those filed in the previous year by around 6%. The counsel for the Federation argued that ââ¦The CBDT had very conveniently and consciously not addressed itself to the hard reality that the utilities for E-filing the tax audit reports and I-T returns were released at a belated stage.â For instance, substantive amendments were made in the form of the tax audit reports on October 1 and the utilities were released only on October 22. This had created a complete state of disarray. Even if the two subsequent extensions are taken into consideration, then the total time available is only 85 days instead of 183 days, the counsel pointed out. However, the high court held that CBDT must have taken its decision not to extend the dates further, after due deliberations. Ordering an extension of the due dates may upset the entire functioning of the government and may lead to undesirable results, the high court stated. However, it added that the CBDT may consider issuing an appropriate circular taking a lenient view as regards the consequences of late filing of a tax audit report â relating to penalties prescribed under section 271B of the I-T Act.

NEW DELHI: The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has launched an automated dedicated online portal to receive and process complaints of tax evasion, foreign undisclosed assets as well as complaints regarding benami properties, said CBDT. The step has been taken towards e-governance and encouraging participation of citizen as stakeholders in curbing tax evasion, according to an official press release. The public can now file a Tax Evasion Petition through a link on the e-filing website of the department (https://www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in/) under the head "File complaint of tax evasion/undisclosed foreign asset/ Benami property". The facility allows for the filing of complaints by persons who are existing PAN/Aadhaar holders as well as for persons having no PAN /Aadhaar. After an OTP based validation process (mobile and/or email), the complainant can file complaints in respect of violations of the Income Tax Act, 1961, Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Assets and Income) Imposition of Tax Act, 1961 and Prevention of Benami Transactions Act (as amended) in three separate forms designed for the purpose. Upon the successful filing of the complaint, the department will allot a unique number to each complaint and the complainant would be able to view the status of the complaint on the Department's website. This e-portal is yet another initiative of the income tax (I-T) department to bring about enhanced ease of interaction with the department while strengthening its resolve towards e-governance.

NEW DELHI: India has seen among the fastest revival of domestic air travel globally, with only China ahead of it, after countries started allowing these flights by following Covid protocol. Thanks to this, Airbus says it delivered the highest numbers of aircraft â 57 â to Indian carriers in pandemic 2020, the European aerospace majorâs (India & south Asia) president and MD, RÃ©mi Maillard, has told TOI. âScheduled domestic flights here were suspended for two months from March 25 to May 25. Domestic air travel now back to 60% of pre-Covid level. No other region, except China, has seen that kind of swift recovery,â he said, while adding that he is âcautiously optimisticâ about the industry which is ânot yet out of the woods and is still bleeding cash.â âA number of issues need to be taken care of (in India) like taxation and infrastructure. The pandemic will lead to people preferring to travel direct between India and rest of the world (something which was done largely by transiting via nearby mega hubs in the Gulf and southeast Asia). India has a huge domestic market that can reconfigure the contours of international air travel to and from the country in favour of Indian carriers if the required steps are taken in terms of taxation and infrastructure,â he said. While Airbus has no plans to have a final assembly line in India â China has one, â the aerospace major says it is firmly committed to the make in India plan. âWe are hopeful that India will contribute significantly technologically to the next-gen zero emission hydrogen-powered aircraft Airbus is working on.â In pandemic 2020, Airbus had delivered 566 aircraft (wide plus narrow bodies) to 87 customers â 34% below its all-time high of 863 in 2019. Its Indian customers got over 10% came of those planes with IndiGo inducting 44 A320/21neos and the remaining 13 going to Vistara, AirAsia India and GoAir. âWe are in discussion with some startup airlines in India for aircraft (for aircraft orders),â he said.

While they took a mix of narrow and wide and bodies, Indian carriers took only single aisle A320 and A321neos. Airbus had delivered 566 aircraft (wide plus narrow bodies) last year to 87 customers â 34% below its all-time high of 863 in 2019 â of which 10% came to India.

IndiGo has placed orders of 730 A320 family of aircraft, making it the biggest customer of this best-selling single aisle globally. The airline returned about 50 older version of A320s while inducting the 20% more fuel efficient A320neo (24) and A321neo (20). In 2019, it had inducted 39 new A320neos.

NEW DELHI: Indian and British carriers will continue operating 30 weekly flights till January 30. The government had earlier this year cleared partial resumption of flights to and from the UK from January 8 by allowing Indian carriers to operate 15 weekly flights and a similar permission was given to UK carriers, till January 23. Based on how the situation of the new and more infectious strain of Coronavirus was, the frequency of these flights were to be reassessed. âThe frequency, 15 weekly by Indian and as many by British carriers, remains the same for now. The current approval is up to January 30,â said a senior official. India had suspended flights to and from the UK on December 23, 2020. At that time, 67 flights per week were operated by four airlines â British Airways (29), Air India (23), Virgin Atlantic (8) and Vistara (7) â between London and 10 Indian cities including Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Goa, Amritsar and Kochi under an air bubble agreement. Before December 23, almost 2,000-2,500 passenger used to fly to India daily from the UK on the 67 weekly flights (66 from London Heathrow and one from Birmingham). Flights were allowed to partially resume on January 8, 2021, and to ensure following of stricter Covid testing norms only 30 weekly flights were initially allowed to and from the four metros of Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. The health ministry had issued very strict norms to minimise the chances of the more infectious UK strain from spreading in India.

NEW DELHI: Passengers travelling to the Netherlands are now required to undergo a Covid test within four hours of their flight departure time at the origin. This is in addition to the existing requirement of getting the RT-PCR test done within 72 hours of arrival time in Holland. A negative result from the new 4-hour pre-departure test will be needed to board flights to Netherlands. The rule is effective immediately and is the latest in the tightening of testing norms by various countries after the emergence of new and more infectious strains of Coronavirus. "Cost of the (new 4-hour) test will be borne by passengers. They are requested to arrive at the airport 5-6 hours prior as check-in will be permitted only after obtaining the test result," KLM said in a travel advisory issued Saturday. Holland's four-hour is the shortest pre-departure testing time that ranges from 96 to 48 hours for other countries. "The latest advisory by the government of the Netherlands requires all passengers arriving in the Netherlands effective January 23, 2021, to undergo a rapid antigen test within 4 hours prior to departure," KLM India tweeted on Saturday. India has an air bubble arrangement with the Netherlands and France and Air France-KLM operate flights under that along with Air India. From India, KLM says it "has made arrangements with the labs at the airport. KLM globally has made network adjustments, at the moment India operations are as scheduled." The four-hour pre-departure test is mandatory for all passengers going to Amsterdam, including transit flyers. "This (4-hour) test is in addition to the existing mandatory RT-PCR test (maximum 72 hours prior arrival in Netherlands) regulations and test requirements. For departures ex India, KLM has made arrangements with the laboratories at the airport for the administration of the required antigen test" a travel advisory by KLM says. These arrangements have been made at airports of Indian cities to which KLM currently operate like Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi. Due to the fast evolving nature of countries' responses to the Covid outbreak, all passengers are personally responsible to ascertain eligibility based on entry requirements for transit and destination countries, it adds. An increasing number of countries are tightening their Covid norms after the new and more infectious strains began to emerge. Lufthansa Group will require all passengers and crew to wear medical protective category â and not everyday use â masks from February 1. The new rule, applicable on all Lufthansa Group airlines on flights to and from Germany. Lufthansa operates flights to and from India under an air bubble arrangement.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu has barred UAE's flydubai from flying in passengers to the state till the month-end after the budget carrier brought a Covid positive passenger to Chennai this Sunday (January 17). The state government has also written to the Union aviation ministry to examine how this happened in violation of Tamil Nadu's entry norms for those flying in from abroad, said senior officials. This is perhaps the first instance of an Indian state barring a foreign airline from flying in people for violating its Covid rules. Indian carriers have been barred a few times during the pandemic for varying periods of time by Hong Kong and UAE for inadvertently flying Covid positive passengers there. Saudi Arabia allows Indian carriers to only fly out people from there to India and not to the Kingdom. A flydubai spokesperson said: "...we are in discussion with the local authorities. We take this very seriously and an investigation is underway. We continue to take all precautionary measures on our flights." UAE requires people flying in from several countries including India to undergo a Covid test 96 hours before their flight departure time and only those with negative reports are allowed to board flights for there. Chennai has a similar rule. Additionally, there is testing on arrival in Dubai for those coming from India and many other countries. "This person got a Covid test done from a certified lab in Chennai last Friday (Jan 15) and tested negative. He then travelled flydubai to Dubai. His on-arrival testing in Dubai gave a positive report," said sources. The passenger was then asked to quarantine himself as per rules, with the positive report uploaded on the app travellers to Dubai need to install on their smartphones. "On January 17, this person went to Dubai Airport and showed his two day old negative report for being allowed to board a flydubai flight to Chennai. Since the report was from a test done within 96 hours before departure for Chennai, he was allowed to board the flight as per rules of Tamil Nadu," said sources. On arrival in Chennai this passenger reportedly cleared both immigration and health checks by showing his negative report. "He was stopped at customs for baggage checks. To avoid the same, the passenger said he is Covid positive and showed his report from the test done on arrival in Dubai which was in his phone app. That is how it was known he was actually infected with the virus," said sources. The state government then barred flydubai from flying in passengers to Chennai from January 21 to 31, 2021, and has asked the Centre to examine this lapse. Aviation authorities are seeking clarification from flydubai, said an official. The airline is yet to decide if it will operate flights to only fly out people from Chennai to Dubai in this period. It cancelled the Chennai flight on Friday. Comments have been sought from flydubai and are awaited. It operates about 100 weekly flights between Dubai and 10 Indian cities including all the metros. During the pandemic there have been several instances of airlines allowing boarding of passengers based on negative test reports and then those flyers testing positive on arrival during random or mandatory tests. "We go as per rules and require passengers to show test reports as per the destination's entry requirement. With tests needed to be done 96 to 48 hours before departure (different rules for different states and countries), there is a possibility that a person who was found negative in those tests giving a positive report in tests done on arrival. This is not something done internationally in a majority of such cases," said a senior official of an Indian carrier. The UAE had earlier decided not to accept test reports from certain labs in India with whom this discrepancy was found a lot.

NEW DELHI: Gratuity is a part of the salary, which the employee receives from his employer in return for the job/services offered by the employee to the organization. Gratuity is defined as a benefit plan and is one of the major after-job perks the employee receives from the employer after leaving the job. There are three main ways to calculate your gratuity balance: 1.) Through govt websiteThe government of India offers an online tool that helps in calculating the investment amount. This calculator computes the amount of Gratuity Pay with respect to the input values of basic pay as last drawn a monthly salary as on date is taken into account, DA - dearness allowance, Number of years and months served, the gratuity coverage of Indian Act 1972 and the commission on salary. Here is the direct link to calculate 2.) Ask your employerThe employer or the HR of the organization has the complete information of all the employees. If somebody wishes to get the information regarding their gratuity benefits along with the salary details. 3.) Calculate yourself using this formula Gratuity amount is calculated on the basis of the last drawn salary and tenure of service. This amount is calculated according to the given formula: Last drawn salary (basic salary plus dearness allowance) X number of completed years of service X 15/26 As per this formula, the time period of about six months or more is taken as one year. Thus, once a person completes completed five years and seven months with the organization, the entire time period is considered as six years while calculating the gratuity benefit. On the other hand, if the time period of the service is five years and five months while calculating the gratuity amount it will be counted as five years. An employer can, however, give higher gratuity than the amount under the prescribed formula.  What is the eligibility for gratuity?If you want to receive gratuity, it becomes compulsory that you have completed a minimum of 5 years of service with your organization. The gratuity is paid before the completion of 5 years of service if the employee becomes disabled due to an accident or disease or expires. Is the notice period considered for gratuity?Since your service for any organization is counted till the last day you work or the day you are relieved, so your notice period is also regarded in the time-frame while paying the gratuity. Can gratuity be received without resigning?To avail of gratuity, employees should be eligible for superannuation and should have resigned post-completion of 5 years with the same employer or company. What should I do if the company is not releasing gratuity?In case the employer denies an employee gratuity, the individual can file a complaint under Section 8 of the act, against the respective firm.

The NPS account holder can contribute regularly in a pension account during their working life. They can withdraw a part of the corpus in a lump sum at the time of retiring and use the rest amount to an annuity of their will. In 2018, the government of India has made NPS more tax-friendly by providing complete tax exemption to the 60 per cent of the corpus that an investor can withdraw on maturity.

If you are an NPS account holder and want to withdraw your account, then you need to submit a withdrawal application to the applicable Point of Presence (POP) along with the relevant documents(Most of the banks, both private and public sector, are enrolled as POPs). After the authentication of the documents, POP will forward them to the Central Record-keeping Agency (CRA) and NSDL. Once CRA receives your application form, they will register your request for withdrawal and forward the application form to you. Along with that, CRA will mention the details of documents that you need to submit. Once you complete the process, CRA will direct to the final stage and settle the account.

For monthly interest, only the amount in thousands will be taken into consideration, the balance will continue earning at the prevailing interest rate.  How does the account work?  An SSY account is opened and used by the natural or legal guardian of the girl child until she turns 10.   After the child is 10, she can operate the account herself, however, deposit in the account may be made by the guardian or any other concerned authority.  Conditions under which the account be closed prematurely  In case of the death of the account holder, the account will immediately be closed as soon as the death certificate is issued by the competent authority, and the balance in the account will be paid with the interest till the month preceding the month of the closing of the account, to the guardian of the account holder.   In case, a request for the premature closure can be put forward after the completion of five years after the account is opened. This too is acceptable, as per the rules, on extreme compassionate conditions like medical support in life-threatening diseases. But if the account has to be closed for another reason, it can be done but the full deposit will only get interest as per a Post Office Savings Bank account.  Is the account transferable?  Yes, the account can be transferred from any part of the country if the girl child in whose name the account has been opened reallocates to some other place.  The transfer is free of cost on providing the proof of shifting of residence of the parent/guardian or account holder herself. If the proof is not submitted, the applicant will have to pay Rs 100 to the post office or bank to which the transfer is made.  What are the rules for partial withdrawal?  In case of any sudden financial requirements related to higher education and marriage, withdrawal of up to 50 per cent of the balance from the account at the end of preceding financial year is allowed. However, withdrawal of the amount is allowed only after the account holder is 18 years old.   In order to get this, a written application along with documentary proof in the form of a confirmed admission in an educational institution or a fee slip from the institution stating the financial requirement needs to be submitted. Moreover, the withdrawal amount will be limited to the actual fee and other charges required at the time of admission.  When will the account mature? The account matures after 21 years as noted from the date of opening or whenever the girl child gets married, whichever happens first, subject to the following: *In case where the marriage of the account holder takes place before the completion of the time period of 21 years, the operation of the account will not be permitted after the marriage date. *Also, if the account is closed before the completion of 21 years, the account holder will have to produce an affidavit showing that the girl child is not less than 18 years as on the date of closing of the account. On maturity, the balance, including the interest outstanding in the account, will be payable to the account holder after the withdrawal slip and passbook are submitted. Can an NRI girl child open an SSY account?  A girl child is eligible for an SSY account only if she is a resident Indian citizen at the time of opening the account and remains so until the maturity or the closure of the account.  Moreover, if the parent/guardian child's residential status changes to non-resident during the term of the scheme, zero interest will be paid from the date of citizenship or residential status changes and the account will be considered closed.  What are the tax benefits available in the scheme? As of 2018, SSY offers the highest tax-free return with an assurance that comes with the exempt-exempt-exempt (EEE) status. The annual deposit (contributions) qualifies for Section 80C benefit and the maturity benefits are non-taxable.

The new Goods and Services Tax (GST) has evolved the way businesses use to bill their clients and customers in the country. If you are one those wondering how to calculate GST returns, here is a step by step guide for to help you: Step 1: The first step is to find the exact slab rate for the goods or services under the GST Act. To find GST Rate, you will have to determine the type of supply item, i.e., whether is it a good or a service. If the supply is a good, find the HSN Code and if the transaction involves the supply of a service, then find the SAC Code. All these details is available on the official website of GST. Once you know the HSN or SAC Code, then find out under which slab of GST tax rate the supply fits into. The GST Council has created 5 different slab rates at NIL/0%, 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% for both goods and services. Click here to find the list of goods and service tax rates. Step 2: Once you know the GST rate, next find out the applicability of IGST or CGST and SGST. To do so, you need to determine the place of supply first. Mostly, the place where the supply of goods or services was done would be the address where the goods or the service was provided. But in case of e-commerce or OIDAR services, the determination of the place of supply is a more complex issue. Step 3: Under GST rule, the supplier of the goods or service can collect tax from the recipient and remit the same to the government. However, there are some services like 'reverse charge services', where the recipient is made liable for payment of GST. Step 4: According to new GST rules, suppliers must maintain extensive accounts, records and file 3 GST forms in a month. However, small businesses having a turnover of less than Rs 75 lakhs, can enrol under the GST Composition Scheme and pay a flat GST based on their aggregate turnover. You should check whether your supplier is enrolled under GST Composition Scheme or not. Step 5: Next is to find out the type of transactions, for example - Business to Business; Business to Consumer where the value of supply is more than Rs 2.5 lakhs; or Business to Consumer where the value of supply is less than Rs 2.5 lakhs.  What if I donât file my GST returns?Not filing any GST return would result in not able to file the subsequent return. For instance, if the GSTR-2 return of August is not filed then the next return GSTR-3 and subsequent returns of September cannot be filed. How do I fill out a GST annual return?Login to GST Portal and go to 'Returns Dashboard' and click 'Annual Return'. Select the 'Financial Year' on the 'File Annual Returns' page. What is the maximum sum that could be penalized for GST?The maximum late fee of Rs 5000 has been decided. Can the GST registration get canceled without filing returns?For cancelation, you have to file all your returns and clear all your dues with the GST department for the cancellation of your registration.

NEW DELHI: In a sweeping move that may lead to legal challenges and further acrimony between India and China in the digital space, the government has permanently banned 59 Chinese apps, and these are believed to include top ones such as ByteDanceâs TikTok, Baidu, WeChat, Alibabaâs UC Browser, shopping app Club Factory, Mi Video Call (Xiaomi), and BIGO Live. All the permanently banned apps had already been censured in the Indian internet space as part of the governmentâs unprecedented action against a total of 267 apps (in various batches) since June-end last year. The government had originally initiated action against the Chinese apps under Section 69A of the IT Act, accusing them of engaging in activities prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, the security of state and public order. 43 new Chinese apps banned, 267 in allThe permanent ban comes in after officials in the IT Ministry expressed dissatisfaction with the response of the companies to various queries raised by the government, including their data collection and data processing methods as well as those around data security and privacy. Others believed to have been permanently banned include SHAREit, Likee, Weibo, and Xiaomi's Mi Community. The government had started to squeeze the influence and sway of Chinese apps in India in view of the growing tensions (including on the border) between the two countries, especially as they were accused of misusing the data of Indian citizens and businesses, surveillance and engaging in anti-India activities. Those ordered blocked in the previous rounds had been served notice by the IT Ministry and were asked to provide details with regards to their operations in India, their subscribers, their data collection and information processing practices, among other things. The long list of questions also sought details about âunauthorised data accessâ by the Chinese companies to having weak security features leading to espionage or surveillance through unauthorised data access. Official sources said that the companies were served notice around the permanent ban last week on an individual basis. A spokesperson for Xiaomi said, "Mi India is in compliance with all government orders and will continue to do so and engage with the relevant stakeholders for the same.â

NEW DELHI: The Union Budget is around the corner and given the tough year it has been due to the pandemic, the expectations of the salaried taxpayers are high. The year 2020 was challenging for the salaried class. From salary cuts to coping with additional expenses due to remote working and inability to claim certain exemptions like fuel reimbursements, etc, the salaried class braved it all. Given this, the taxpayers are expecting relief in the form of increase in exemptions/deductions from the government in the upcoming Budget. Last yearâs Budget introduced the new concessional tax regime that offers an individual the option to choose lower tax rates in lieu of forgoing certain tax exemptions and deductions. Some of these benefits include standard deduction, exemption towards house rent allowance, leave travel allowance, house property loss, and deduction towards provident fund contributions and life insurance premiums. Budget 2021: Why finance minister should not bring in any new taxThe new regime, effective from financial year 2020-21, prescribes tax rates ranging from 5% to 30% with the highest tax rate applicable for income above Rs 15 lakh. This option is beneficial in those cases where an individual has fewer exemptions and deductions to be claimed. Individuals with higher income levels and tax-saving investments qualifying for deductions or exemptions may not find the new regime attractive. Evaluation of certain factors will be important for individual taxpayers before deciding whether to continue with the old tax regime or opt for the new tax regime.     Individuals with limited deductions or exemptions would have the advantage of more tax savings by opting for the new tax regime. The level of tax savings would depend on the income levels and every individual would have to undertake a fact-specific evaluation keeping in mind her/his investments. While the new tax regime is beneficial for a select segment of individual taxpayers, there is a need to address the expectations of the other set of individual taxpayers who prefer to invest for securing their future and would like to avail the deductions linked to investments.   The pandemic has resulted in a financial burden on many and, hence, the taxpayers are looking for relaxations like extension of benefit to non-senior citizens (under the current law, senior citizens are allowed deduction of up to Rs 50,000) for medical expenditure under Section 80D, increasing the cap of interest on housing loan, extension of additional benefits available for first-time homebuyers, extending the benefit of the newly introduced LTC cash voucher to the next financial year, additional investment opportunities for availing tax benefits through investment in infrastructure bonds etc. Given the varied profile of taxpayers, there exists a case for coexistence of both the regimes going forward. - Amarpal S Chadha(The author is Tax Partner, EY India.

NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman faces a huge challenge this year. The Covid pandemic raged through 2020, roiling economies and ruining many lives. The governmentâs revenues are down but expenditure commitments are up (think of the free vaccines promised). What path should the finance minister now take? Should she try and balance the books by levying additional taxes? Say, introduce a temporary Covid-19 cess at the highest income-tax slab, or maybe reintroduce the wealth tax? Or, should she focus on maintaining tax stability while stepping up expenditure for economic revival? To understand how both scenarios could play out, letâs first look at what impact moderate tax rates have on the tax-GDP ratio and how this compares with a high-tax regime. Union Budget 2021-22: Complete coverageEYâs analysis of the historical tax rates in India shows that we have come a long way in achieving the objective of a rational and moderate tax rate regime. For instance, in 1971, the personal tax system had as many as 12 tax brackets, with tax rates ranging from zero to 85%. With surcharge, the highest tax rate worked out to a staggering 93.5%. The effective burden of personal taxes was reduced in successive years as governments recognised that moderate rates, a wider base and higher compliance made for a better tax policy as opposed to high rates. In 1992-93, the tax rates were considerably simplified: only four tax brackets, with the peak rate at 40%. The 1997-98 âDream Budgetâ -- presented by P Chidamabaram -- cut the peak personal income-tax rate from 40% to 30% and the corporate income-tax rates from 40% to 35% for domestic firms. This announcement set the new peak tax rate for personal income-tax which continues until today, although with additional surcharges the highest tax burden is now 42.7%. The immediate impact of the Dream Budget was a sharp fall in the tax-GDP ratio. But, soon after, moderate rates led to better compliance. The government also took measures to broaden the tax base. So, eventually, the tax-GDP ratio got much better. Consider the numbers. After the 1997-98 Budget, personal tax collections fell by 6%. However, in the next five years (FY1999 to FY2003), the average personal tax-GDP ratio jumped to 1.4% as against 1.2% in the previous five years (FY1993 to FY1997). A similar effect was observed in the corporate tax collections too, where the average CIT-GDP ratio increased from 1.4% in the previous five years (FY1993 to FY1997) to 1.6% in the next five years (FY1999 to FY2003). This sustained increase in the tax-GDP ratio was achieved despite India facing global economic headwinds and a three-year growth slowdown between FY2000 and FY2002. The data suggests that stability and a gradual moderation of tax rates resulted in a positive behavioural response with better compliance, leading to an increase in the direct taxes-to-GDP ratio in the long run. Compared to other developing countries, Indiaâs peak individual effective tax rate is still on the higher side:   Indiaâs peak effective tax rate (after including surcharge and cess) hovered between 30% and 35.9% till last year. The hike in surcharge rate by the Finance Act, 2020 catapulted the peak rate to the present level. The Prime Minister has launched the initiative of âHonouring the Honestâ. In keeping with this spirit, in times of crisis, the focus may need to be on stability, encouraging compliance, broadening the tax base and boosting consumption to improve tax collections. To this effect, certain measures have already been announced and it is expected that Budget 2021 will be constructed around these themes. In the circumstances, any additional burden on existing taxpayers or any new taxes like wealth tax/estate duty, which were discontinued earlier for reasons of high administrative costs and low revenue yield, may not be in sync. The mantra for the FM in Budget 2021 should be âNo New Taxâ. - By Anish Thacker & Shalini Mathur (Thacker is tax partner, and Mathur, director, tax & economic policy, EY India.

LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday held the BJP-led central government responsible for turning farmers' "resentment into anger" and demanded immediate withdrawal of new agri laws. His remarks come after clashes broke out at multiple places during the farmers' tractor parade in Delhi on Tuesday. Tens of thousands of protesters broke through barriers, fought with police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the iconic Red Fort. "The way the BJP government has continuously neglected, humiliated and accused the farmers, it played a decisive role in turning the resentment of the farmers into anger. Only the BJP is responsible for the present situation," Yadav said in a tweet in Hindi. He said the government should immediately withdraw the farm laws considering it as its moral responsibility.

UNITED NATIONS: India has announced a pledge of $150,000 to activities of the Peacebuilding Fund this year and said that 2021 provides the international community with an opportunity to look at peacebuilding in a more focused manner, especially in the context of the Covid pandemic. âWhile I would like to assure you all of our sincere commitment to remain engaged in peacebuilding, we extend our support to the activities of the Peacebuilding Fund and as a token of our engagement, India would like to announce today a pledge of $150,000 to the fund's activities and programme this year,â India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti said. In a virtual address to the High-Level Replenishment Conference for the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund Tuesday, he said India believes that 2021 provides the international community with an opportunity to look at peacebuilding in the broader context and in a more focused manner, especially in the context of the Covid pandemic, which is threatening to erode the gains made over the years. He added that the recently concluded 2020 review of the UN peacebuilding architecture provides a framework to strengthen peace building collectively. He voiced appreciation that as a part of its 2020-24 strategy, the Peacebuilding Fund has put forth a comprehensive scenario covering a horizon of five years. The Fund requires 1.5 billion dollars for 2020-2024. âThere is no doubt that conflict prevention is essential to ensure that peacekeeping translates into something more durable for the benefit of the people,â he said, adding that for this determined support is needed from member states to strengthen the hands of the United Nations. He emphasised that strengthening security structures go hand in hand with strengthening civilian structures of good governance. âWe need to consequently prioritise our focus on specific aspects of peacebuilding, which will have the highest impact in post-conflict situations, so that the funds are utilised to the optimum.â UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said at the conference that peacebuilding in fragile contexts requires political courage and leadership at national and local levels, but also the right support at the right time from the international community. âWe need to take risks for peace and enable stakeholders with the resources and space to seize opportunities. We have a responsibility to bring down the institutional silos and bring together, in an agile and responsive manner, the full range of the UN system capacities,â he said. The UN chief pointed out that as the medium-term effects of the COVID19 pandemic become more apparent, it is more important than ever to ensure the fund is adequately and predictably resourced. In 2020, the Peacebuilding Fund mobilised over $180 million, which Guterres said is an important sign of the trust the fund has garnered over the years and its demonstrated ability to deliver in the most difficult contexts. "But its resources are now depleted. We must urgently replenish it. Doing so will save lives and serve as a clear demonstration of multilateral support.â Tirumurti highlighted India's constructive and significant role in the context of peacebuilding through its extensive development partnership in developing countries, particularly in Africa and Asia. India continues to assist countries bilaterally in post-conflict situations by providing substantial grants and soft loans, apart from focusing on infrastructure, especially housing, education and health, on connectivity, providing livelihood to those impacted by conflict, especially in agriculture and on projects at the grassroots level. He cited the example from Afghanistan, where India has undertaken projects in every province of the country. India has tried to enhance the security environment of these countries since peace, security and development have to go together. India is also fulfilling its commitment to make available its Covid-19 vaccines to other countries and has already supplied more than six million doses to nine countries in phase one as grant assistance. The Peacebuilding Fund is the UN's financial instrument of first resort to sustain peace in countries or situations at risk or affected by violent conflict. The Fund's 2020-2024 strategy is its most ambitious yet, responding to the Secretary-General's call for a quantum leap of support for peacebuilding and prevention. The Fund has invested over $1.2 billion to date in over 60 countries, with support from almost 60 member states. At the close of the conference, the co-chairs issued a Joint Communique stating that the General Assembly would convene a High-Level meeting on financing peace during its 76th session. "The Conference took place at a time of unprecedented challenges and as the world contends with the tragic immediate effects of the pandemic and its alarming medium to long-term impacts. The unprecedented economic shocks and inadequate response strategies are entrenching social and economic inequalities and increasing risks for crisis, eroding peace and development gains along the way," the Joint Communique said. Member states reiterated the importance of investing in peace. Including funds received for 2020, a total of 39 member states have contributed or pledged over $439 million for peacebuilding in support of the Fund's 2020-2024 Strategy which set a target of $1.5 billion.

NEW DELHI: Twitter on Wednesday said it suspended more than 300 accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation as the farmers' tractor rally went violent in the national capital on the 72nd Republic Day. The farmers swarmed the Red Fort and waved farmer union flags from its ramparts. They even hoisted farmer union flags as well as a pennant with a Sikh religious symbol from a flagpole. A Twitter spokesperson told IANS that the company has taken strong enforcement action to protect the conversation on the service from attempts to incite violence, abuse and threats that could trigger the risk of offline harm by blocking certain terms that violate our rules for trends. "Using a combination of technology and human review, Twitter worked at scale and took action on hundreds of Tweets that have been in violation of the Twitter Rules and suspended more than 300 accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation," the spokesperson informed. The Delhi Police on Sunday had warned that 308 Twitter handles have been generated to create confusion over the tractor rally proposed by protesting farmers on Republic Day. "Through intelligence and various other agencies, we have continuously been getting inputs regarding a threat to create disturbance in the tractor rally. Nearly 308 Twitter handles have been generated from Pakistan to create confusion," said Dependra Pathak, Special Commissioner Police, Intelligence, Delhi Police. The microblogging platform said they were monitoring the situation closely and remain vigilant, "and strongly encourage those on the service to report anything they believe is in violation of the rules." In all, 86 policemen were injured in the violence as farmers marched inside Delhi with their tractors ahead of the scheduled time agreed upon with the police authorities of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. A total of 22 FIRs have been filed by the Delhi Police so far in connection with the violence witnessed during the farmers' tractor rally, officials said on Wednesday.

BEIJING: China has begun using anal swabs to test those it considers at high risk of contracting Covid-19, state TV reported, with social media users and travellers squirming over the invasive procedure which doctors say can be more effective in detecting the virus. Officials took anal swabs from residents of neighbourhoods with confirmed Covid-19 cases in Beijing last week, broadcaster CCTV said, while those in designated quarantine facilities have also undergone the test.  Small, localized outbreaks in recent weeks have seen multiple cities in northern China sealed off from the rest of the country and prompted mass testing campaigns -- which up until now have mostly been conducted using throat and nose swabs.  But the anal swabs method "can increase the detection rate of infected people" as traces of the virus linger longer in the anus than in the respiratory tract, Li Tongzeng, a senior doctor from Beijing's You'an Hospital, told CCTV.  Users of China's popular Twitter-like Weibo social media platform reacted to the method with a mix of mirth and horror.  "So lucky I returned to China earlier," one user wrote.  "Low harm, but extreme humiliation," another said, using a laughing emoticon.  Others who had undergone the procedure chimed in with dark humour.  "I've done two anal swabs, every time I did one I had to do a throat swab afterwards -- I was so scared the nurse would forget to use a new swab," one Weibo user joked.  CCTV said on Sunday anal swabs would not be used as widely as other methods, as the technique was "not convenient."  As cases rise around the world, China has imposed stricter requirements on international arrivals in an effort to keep domestic transmission close to zero.  All arrivals into the country must have multiple negative test results and quarantine for at least 14 days in a designated hotel on arrival, with many cities and regions imposing additional home observation requirements.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Cabinet has decided to table a bill in Parliament to amend the Constitution for holding the Senate elections through open vote. The decision was taken during the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, presided over by Prime Minister Imran Khan. âThe government wants the (Senate) polls to be held in a transparent manner and without horse-trading. This is why we want Senate polls to be held through an open ballot,â Information Minister Shibli Faraz told the media after the meeting. He said that in the past, money was used in Senate elections and votes were bought making the House election a mockery. He asked what was the use of an upper house in which people come through purchasing of votes. Faraz also said that people opposing the proposed move are forgetting that their own party had demanded open ballot in the past. âThe government will present a constitutional amendment bill in the parliament so that Senate polls are held through open ballot,â he said. Already the government petitioned to the Supreme Court, seeking direction to hold the upcoming Senate elections through open ballot. The decision is pending. Meanwhile, Dawn newspaper quoted a Cabinet member as saying that Prime Minister Khan tasked his advisor parliamentary affairs Babar Awan to table a bill in the National Assembly for holding Senate elections through open ballot when the adviser was giving a briefing on the status of the government's reference in the Supreme Court. Awan said the government had already laid two bills â Constitution Amendment Bill and Electoral Reforms Bill â in Parliament on the basis of which desired legislation could be done for an open ballot. The Cabinet member said Awan had called a meeting of his ministry and its legislation branch to devise a roadmap on how to proceed with the matter in Parliament. It has been proposed that since Senate polls could not be held through show of hand because every voter has to show his preference in the ballot paper. Therefore, to ensure open identity of the voter, the voter should be required to mention his name on the back side of the ballot paper, according to Dawn newspaper. Senate elections will be held in the first half of next month and prime minister Khan's ruling Pakistan Tehreek-I-Insaf is wary that its own members may vote a gay party policy, according to Opposition parties that are against the move.

TOKYO: Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga apologised on Wednesday after lawmakers from his ruling coalition visited night clubs despite his government's call for people to avoid unnecessary outings to curb the spread of Covid-19. The news is another headache for Suga whose approval rating has tumbled due to dissatisfaction with his handling of the pandemic, which critics have called too slow and inconsistent. "I'm terribly sorry that this happened when we are asking people not to eat out after 8pm and to avoid non-essential, non-urgent outings," Suga told parliament. "Each lawmaker should behave to gain the public's understanding." Japan this month issued a state of emergency in Tokyo and other areas to tame a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases. The measure includes a request for restaurants and bars to close by 8pm although there are currently no penalties for non-compliance. "My behaviour was careless at a time when we are asking people to be patient," Jun Matsumoto, a senior lawmaker from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, told reporters. Matsumoto was speaking following a Daily Shincho magazine report that he had visited two night clubs in Tokyo's posh Ginza district after dining at an Italian restaurant last Monday. Kiyohiko Toyama, a lawmaker from the coalition's junior partner Komeito, also apologised after tabloid Shukan Bunshun reported he had visited a high-end night club in Ginza until late last Friday. Twitter users voiced their frustration. "It is just a matter of time before public anger explodes. I don't want a blanket cash-payout of 100,000 yen ($965), I want them to quit! " wrote one user. "They are really stupid. Don't they think about what they are doing and how the public sees them? If they don't, they are unqualified to represent the public," said another.

NEW DELHI: China's ByteDance is cutting the size of its 2,000-plus India team and is unsure when it will make a comeback, the company told employees in an internal memo on Wednesday, months after its popular TikTok video app was banned. The move came after India this month decided to retain its ban on TikTok and 58 other Chinese apps following responses from the companies on issues such as compliance and privacy. TikTok, WeChat, Baidu and UC Browser among 59 Chinese apps permanently banned in IndiaThe ban dates from last year when political tension between the neighbours rose over their disputed border. "We initially hoped that this situation would be short-lived ... we find that has not been the case," ByteDance wrote in the memo which was seen by Reuters. "We simply cannot responsibly stay fully staffed while our apps remain un-operational ... we don't know when we will make a comeback in India" In a statement, the company said it was disappointing that despite its efforts it had not received a clear direction on how and when its apps could be reinstated. It did not specify how many employees would lose their jobs. Before the ban, India had been one of TikTok's largest markets and ByteDance in 2019 had laid out plans to invest $1 billion in India. At the time of last year's ban, the Indian government described the apps as prejudicial to the "sovereignty and integrity of India". The move followed a skirmish with Chinese troops. In the United States, the previous Trump administration ordered ByteDance to divest TikTok citing national security concerns, and sought to impose restrictions that would have effectively barred its use. TikTok has also come under scrutiny in Australia for any risks it may pose to users from around potential foreign interference and data privacy issues.

SAN FRANCISCO: A spat erupted Tuesday between Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk as the tech titans' space firms exchanged barbs over their rival satellite internet projects being evaluated by regulators. Amazon, founded and led by Bezos, put out a statement claiming Musk's rival SpaceX project Starlink was seeking design changes that could "create a more dangerous environment for collisions in space" and also increase radio interference. "Despite what SpaceX posts on Twitter, it is SpaceX's proposed changes that would hamstring competition among satellite systems," Amazon said in a statement, outlining its objections to regulators. "It is clearly in SpaceX's interest to smother competition in the cradle if they can, but it is certainly not in the public's interest." Musk meanwhile fired off his own objection to Amazon's complaint, claiming that his plan is moving faster than his rival's. "It does not serve the public to hamstring Starlink today for an Amazon satellite system that is at best several years away from operation," Musk tweeted. @thesheetztweetz It does not serve the public to hamstring Starlink today for an Amazon satellite system that is atâ¦ https://t.co/sNiGKxdXFP— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) 1611658035000Musk, who is also the founder of Tesla and recently overtook Bezos as the world's richest person, is in a race against Amazon's $10 billion Project Kuiper space-based internet delivery system, which has won US regulatory approval to deploy more than 3,000 low-orbit satellites. SpaceX has been deploying small satellites to form a global broadband system and is lobbying regulators for permission to move them into lower orbits, which has prompted Amazon's concerns. SpaceX argued in a letter to the Federal Communications Commission that the orbit modifications being sought would not increase chances of interfering with rival satellites. It contended that any claims of such interference were "misleading," and that Amazon was trying to "stifle competition." SpaceX on Sunday launched its Falcon 9 rocket carrying a record number of satellites on board. Scientists have expressed concerns about the number of objects clogging the space around Earth. SpaceX say their satellites are designed to burn up in the atmosphere within a few years. Project Kuiper aims to deliver satellite-based broadband services in the United States, and eventually around the world, and may offer connectivity for wireless carriers and 5G networks.

NEW DELHI: With International Monetary Fund (IMF) projecting that India will reclaim the status of world's fastest-growing economy and projected its growth at 11.5 per cent in 2021, experts on Wednesday said that India is rebounding to achieve the target of a $5 trillion economy. Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal termed the IMF projections for India as "Bright star in the global economy." "Bright Star in Global Economy: India to continue its growth story at rapid pace under PM @NarendraModi ji, with @IMFNews projecting an impressive 11.5% growth rate for India in 2021. It makes India only major economy to register double-digit growth in 2021," Goyal tweeted. Charan Singh, CEO, EGROW Foundation and former RBI chair professor said, "As was expected, and I had been arguing that India's fundamentals are strong, IMF, in its latest release has projected India's growth at 11.5 per cent in 2021 and 6.8 per cent in 2022. This is the highest growth rate to be recorded by any country." Singh said that IMF observed that the substantial revision in India's growth projection is because of stronger than expected recovery after lockdown. "Hence, India has saved the lives of people in lockdown, and now galloping to recoup growth trajectory. This has been due to the well-calibrated, adequately sequenced policies of the Government. Thus, a V-shaped recovery is on the way, and India is rebounding, to achieve a $5 Trillion Economy, despite the Covid set-back," he added. DK Mishra, a market expert, said that Covid-19 pandemic has impacted worldwide economies in a big way but Indian economy has come out of initial hits due to measures taken by government and strong consumer demands. "The same is evident from strong GST collections and good agricultural growth. The projection for 11.50 per cent growth by IMF in GDP is yet another confirmation of the strong recovery of the economy. The future outlook with the Covid vaccine in the market will be good for our economy," he said. In its latest World Economic Outlook update released on Tuesday, the IMF predicted that India's gross domestic product (GDP) will grow at the pace of 11.5 per cent in 2021. IMF projections show that India's economy will grow much better than China which is predicted to grow at 8.1 per cent, followed by Spain (5.9 per cent), France (5.5 per cent) and United States (5.1 per cent).

WASHINGTON: An Indian national has pleaded guilty to conspiracy and identity theft in connection with an overseas robocall scam that defrauded thousands in the US, mostly elderly people, of nearly $8 million, the Department of Justice said. Shehzadkhan Pathan, 39, operated a call centre in Gujarat's Ahmedabad that placed automated robocalls to victims in the United States, as per court documents. After establishing contact with the victims through these automated calls, Pathan and other "closers" at his call centre would coerce, cajole, and trick victims to send bulk cash through physical shipments and electronic money transfers, federal prosecutors alleged. Pathan and his conspirators used a variety of schemes to convince victims to send money, including impersonating law enforcement officers from the FBI and DEA and representatives of other government agencies such as the Social Security Administration, to threaten victims with severe legal and financial consequences. Conspirators also convinced the victims to send money as initial installments for falsely promised loans, the court documents said. According to the court papers, Pathan also recruited and supervised several money mules, who he directed to receive money sent by the victims. His network of money mules was located in multiple states, including but not limited to Virginia, New Jersey, Minnesota, Texas, California, South Carolina, and Illinois. Pathan assigned various aliases to these individuals and supplied them with hundreds of counterfeit identification documents to facilitate their receipt of cash shipments and money transfers. He then directed the money mules to send the money to himself and other conspirators through various means, including cash deposits into numerous bank accounts and via informal money transmitters known as hawalas, the prosecutors alleged. The Department of Justice said Pathan's scams disproportionately targeted elderly victims, many of whom suffered substantial financial hardship. In total, Pathan is responsible for defrauding over 5,000 US victims of at least $8 million, it added. His sentencing is scheduled for May 14. Pathan faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for the conspiracy, along with a mandatory consecutive term of two years for aggravated identity theft.

WASHINGTON: Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna on Saturday hoped for a peaceful and fair solution to the farmers' issues in India, saying he is encouraged by the ongoing dialogue between the protesting farmers and the government. Khanna, 44, was recently elected for a third consecutive term from the congressional district representing Silicon Valley. âIndia and the US share a rich tradition of democracy and peaceful protests. Farmworkers are the backbone of both our nations and must have their voices heard. I hope there's a peaceful and fair solution so they can provide for their families,â Khanna said in a tweet on Saturday. âI am encouraged by the ongoing dialogue,â he said, joining other American lawmakers who have expressed their views on the ongoing farmers' protest in India, several of whom have expressed their concerns. âAs Co-Chair of the American Sikh Caucus in Congress, my office has received first-hand accounts of the horrific crackdowns on protestors who are trying to peacefully express their disapproval of India's recent agricultural reform legislation,â said Congressman John Garamendi, who along with two other lawmakers wrote a letter to India's Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu early this week. According to the letter, âhundreds of thousands of farmers from the states of Punjab and Haryana that have made their way to New Delhi to peacefully protest these new agricultural laws, and the Indian government has met these peaceful protestors with tear gas, water cannons, barricades, baton attacks, and more. âMany of these farmers have children, relatives, and friends who are US citizens, many of whom have reached out to us to share their concerns about these developments. We urge the Indian government to demonstrate its respect for these crucial democratic freedoms, and to be a model of democratic values in the vital Indo-Pacific regionâ. The letter, dated December 4, was released this week. The two other lawmakers who have expressed their concern on the protest were congressman Jim Costa and congresswoman Shelia Jackson Lee, members of the American Sikh Caucus. Thousands of farmers are currently staying put at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. There have been multiple rounds of talks between representatives of the protestors and the government but the logjam continues.

Apple introduced Privacy Labels with iOS 14 update making it mandatory for developers to clearly state their privacy policies. Privacy Labels feature is Appleâs way of making iPhone users understand how their personal information may be used. These Labels became mandatory starting December 8, 2020, which means that all app developers pushing an update to their iOS app after December 8 need to publish Privacy Labels first. It was recently noticed that Google had updated its popular apps like Gmail, Google Drive, Google Photos, YouTube, Google Maps and others on or before December 7. The move is apparently being seen to avoid filling out privacy labels for any of these apps. Around January 6, when this got reported by several tech media platforms globally, Google promised to roll out Privacy Labels within a week to comply with Appleâs new privacy rules. However, itâs January 27, which means that 49 days have passed and Google is still to provide privacy details for its popular apps like Gmail, Google Drive, Google Photos, YouTube, Google Maps and others. Interestingly, Google is providing privacy details about some of its lesser known or used apps like Stadia, Google Translate, Google Authenticator, Wear OS, Google Play Movies and TV and others. But so far there is no word on when it will provide clarity on its mainstream apps. What are Privacy Labels for iOS appsThe new Privacy Labels aims to ensure that app developers reveal all data that they collect from users as well as explain how this data is being used. With iOS 14 update for iPhones, Apple seems to ensure that app developers canât hide behind lengthy and incomprehensible privacy policies and transact with usersâ personal data. To check Privacy Labels of any iOS app, just update your iPhone to iOS 14 and head to the App Store. Inside the App Store, search for a particular app and scroll down to see the privacy information.

Earlier this month, he congratulated the Indian cricket team for its victory in test series in Austraila. âOne of the greatest test series wins ever. Congrats India and well played Australia, what a series #INDvsAUS," said Pichai in a tweet. India beat Australia in the fourth test at Brisbane on January 19 to win the Border-Gavaskar trophy. India won the series 2-1 in Austraila. In July last year, Google CEO had tweeted âGlad cricket is back,â after the game was back after a gap of four months due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Talking to a Washington audience that included then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and top corporate executives from India and the US at the India Ideas Summit of USIBC in 2019, Pichai shared some of his cricket and baseball experiences in the United States. "When I first came here, I tried to kind of adapt to baseball. I have to say it was a bit challenging. In my first game, I was proud because I hit the ball on the back. It's a really good shot in cricket. I was like, well look, what I did. But people didn't appreciate it." "In cricket when you run, you always take your bat with you. So I also ran between base with my bat as well. So eventually, I realised baseball was a bit difficult. I can adjust on many things, but I'm going to stick to cricket," he said.

NEW DELHI: The last day to file income tax returns (ITRs) for the financial year 2019-20 (assessment year 2021-22) is on Sunday, January 10. The Income Tax (I-T) department extended the return filing deadline three times in wake of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. In May last year, the July 31 due date was extended till November 30, which was again extended till December 31 later. However, the I-T department had further extended the deadline by 10 days till January 10, 2021 in view of the challenges faced by taxpayers. The January 10 deadline for filing ITR is for those individuals whose accounts are not required to be audited and who usually file their return using ITR-1 and ITR-4 forms.

NEW DELHI: In today's time, owning a home is a desired dream which is spoilt by a long EMI burden. And, this burden leaves a sizeable dent in one's monthly income. To avoid the same, one is required to plan smartly keeping in mind the EMI (Equated Monthly Installment), rate of interest and loan tenure as these play a significant role in the home loan repayment. Here, we have listed down some tips that would help in reducing your EMI burden: Increase in the EMI payments: You can pay off your loan much faster if you increase your EMI payments. Usually, tenure of the home loan is a minimum of 5 years and if you are a working individual then your salary would increase during the tenure of the loan. So, that increased salary can be used for repayment of the loan by increasing the usual EMI payment as this would close the loan early. Make payments in advance: If you have received some additional income in terms of bonus, increment or any other source then you can route it towards prepayment of your loan. If you choose to make an advance payment of the loan with a good amount then you can either pay the same EMI by reducing the loan tenure or go for the same loan tenure but with reduced EMI. Therefore, it is suggested that one must opt to pay a larger EMI as this will help in closing the loan faster and reduce the total interest to be paid. Repay your loan ahead of time: One must try to repay the loan before time if there is enough money collected by an individual. So if you repay the loan amount ahead of time it would help you save on the interest amount that you need to pay on the loan. So, if you maintain financial discipline then you can easily free yourself from EMIs. Also, try to utilize your extra income in the best possible way. Here are some of the most common questions asked about home loan EMIs: What is home loan EMI?It is a monthly repayment that a home loan borrower must make to repay the home loan within the stipulated time period. What are the factors that affect home loan EMI?  Principal (loan amount)  Rate of interest  Tenure  What is the formula to calculate EMI on a home loan?EMI = [P x R x (1+R)^N]/[(1+R)^N-1], whereP is the loan amount R is the interest rate per month N is the number of monthly installments Can I pay my home loan early?Yes, you can make a prepayment of your home loan before the tenure. Also, this will help you save a lot of money.

NEW DELHI: Home loan is one of the biggest financial commitments that one makes in life. However, it is not very easy to pay off a home loan. Since the home loan amount is usually high therefore its interest amount is a big add on. But still, it is possible to save money. Given below are the simple tips that can help you save money on the home loan repayment: Prepay the amount of the loan: Prepaying the loan amount can lower down the interest to be paid. For loan prepayment, one needs to be financially disciplined and committed. Furthermore, the applicant need not pay pre-closure charges if the interest rate on home loan is adjustable (floating). But in case of fixed rate, a penalty or fee needs to be paid. Ask for a lower interest rate: The loan applicant can save money on a lower interest rate. One needs to negotiate on the rate of interest with the bank. Being an old and loyal customer, the bank would definitely regard and provide a lower interest rate. Do the research in advance: Before applying for a home loan, one needs to do a lot of research. There might be a possibility that two banks have the same rate of interest but the application fee and other charges may vary. Therefore, thorough research is a must as it would help in saving a lot of money. The loan applicant can also compare the home loans through online marketplaces and choose the best which suits his/her requirements. Make investments: Start making investments in different schemes so that a good amount can be collected to make the down payment for the home loan. If the down payment is paid in a huge amount then the loan amount would be less and this would further help in getting a lower interest rate. Transfer the home loan balance: In the process of the home loan balance transfer, one bank takes over the home loan from an existing bank. Usually, the bank that takes over the home loan, offers a lower rate of interest to the loan applicant. This further helps you with lower interest amount and lesser loan tenure. Obtaining home loan balance transfer is easy and effective for the purpose of saving interest. Always keep in kind that prepaying your home loan to the maximum, making investments and channelizing the income in a better way can be of great help in terms of saving. So, follow the tips given above and go high on savings. Here are some of the most common questions asked about home loan prepayment: What is the benefit of home loan prepayment?Home loan prepayment leads in financial benefits and help in reducing the interest rate. Can I pay more than EMI for a home loan?Yes, you can pay more than EMI for your home loan. The surplus amount will reduce your principal outstanding and interest burden. Is home loan prepayment a tax benefit?Home loan prepayment in addition to your EMI will also cover under section 80C for your income tax deductions as this amount is a repayment of your principal amount. What are home loan prepayment charges?You will have to pay a prepayment penalty to the bank if the interest rate on home loan is fixed.

NEW DELHI: Buying a house of your own is not that simple. And you might opt to apply for a home loan to make that dream come true. But the amount that you are eligible for the loan might not be sufficient enough. So to come out or tackle such a situation, one needs to work out ways and increase the eligible amount and buy a house of their own. The applicant is required to go through the important factors that are mentioned below in order to increase their home loan eligibility:  Increase the loan tenure: The home loan eligibility is calculated on the basis of the applicant's repayment capacity on a monthly basis. By increasing the home loan tenure with the same monthly repayment capacity, one can borrow more money for the home loan. But don't forget that by increasing the home loan tenure you would end up repaying more interest amount. Clear the outstanding liabilities: If an individual has other outstanding debts, loans or liabilities, then their chances are less for increasing the home loan eligibility. The EMIs paid for the other liabilities are deducted from the monthly repayment capacity resulting in decreasing the loan amount. So one must try to repay these loans and liabilities from other sources to increase the home loan amount. And this is only possible if the amount of debt or liability is within the individual's reach. Under normal circumstances, around 15 to 18 remaining EMIs are considered repayable. Combine the family income: If an individual's income is not enough to get the required home loan then he or she should try to combine the incomes of other family members for repayment of the loan that makes a positive impact. The acceptable combined income from the family includes the income of father, mother, children or spouse. Step up loan is an option: By choosing step up loan as an option one can pay a lower EMI in the starting and gradually increase the EMI as the tenure and the source of income progresses with time. The eligible home loan amount is calculated on the basis of a higher income than the current earnings. Also, young professionals or those who have just started their careers can invest in property by choosing step up loan. Count all the profits and bonuses: Except for the basic salary, one must include his/her extra incomes and gains that are provided by an employer. This would increase the eligible home loan amount and will have a positive impact on the repayment capacity. Extra incomes include performance bonus or additional pay for overtime. Moreover, this option varies from bank to bank.

Equity Linked Saving Schemes or also commonly called as ELSS, are the great options for tax saving investment. But if you are considering investing in the ELSS funds then you should know everything about it. Here's we give you five points that you should know about ELSS funds before you invest into one of these funds: 1) Lock-in periodIt is a fact that ELSS, the tax saving mutual funds, have the shortest mandatory lock-in period as compared to other investment options available under Section 80C of Income Tax Act. For example, an ELSS has a lock-in period of three years, whereas a Public Provident Fund (PPF) account has 15 years of the lock-in period. However, ELSSs should not be considered a short-term investment product. Your investment horizon in ELSSs should be of at least five to seven years. Also, it is not advisable to take out money out of ELSS funds before 3 years. Consider ELSS funds for long term investment plans. 2) RiskWhat puts off most of the new investors from ELSS is the fact that it invests mostly in stocks and hence carries a higher risk. But you can minimize the risk by having a long-time investment horizon in ELSS. And that's why it is advisable to keep investing in ELSS even after 3 years of the lock-in period. The only way to beat the volatility of the market and to make superior returns from stocks is by staying invested for a long period. 3) Equity investment experienceELSS is an ideal way to begin your investment in the equity market. Since ELSS come with a mandatory lock-in period of three years, it gives investors a chance to get used to the volatility of the stock market. It would be a good equity market debut for many investors for their future investment in other equity mutual fund schemes. 4) Section 80C allows only Rs 1.5 lakh of investmentThe Section 80C of the Income Tax Act allows you to claim the tax deduction on investment up to Rs 1.5 lakh only. The Section 80C is an overcrowded section where many investment options qualify for tax deduction, for example, PPF, EPF, FD, NPS, NSC, ULIP etc. So, you need to calculate before finalizing the amount you would be investing in ELSS funds because, if you invest more than the required amount, it won't give you extra deduction under Section 80C. 5) Be realistic about returnsYes, ELSSs hold strong potential to offer good returns because they invest mostly in equity stocks. However, you have to be realistic about your expectation from the returns. For better returns, you need to be invested for a longer term.  How safe is investing in ELSS funds?ELSS funds are one of safe ways to have exposure in equity market compared to directly investing in Equities. It is advisable to do a SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) in ELSS rather than investing a lumpsum amount as it would factor in the market fluctuations and reduces the risk. Why ELSS is considered as a good investment option?Equity Linked Savings Scheme, commonly called ELSS is a type of diversified equity mutual fund which is qualified for tax exemption under section 80C of the I-T Act. It offers the twin-advantage of capital appreciation and tax benefits. Hence, ELSS makes a very good investment option for tax saving as well as investment.  Is maturity of ELSS taxable or not?Equity Linked Saving Schemes (ELSS) qualify for tax deductions of up to Rs 1.5 lakh under Section 80C of Income Tax Act.  Is there a lock-in period for ELSS funds?Yes, ELSS funds have a lock-in period of three years.

A number of sections under income tax falls under the category where you can claim deductions for investments and expenses incurred during the particular financial year. Deductions like these help in bringing down the taxable income and also reduce your tax liability. For further information, in many cases, a lock-in period is specified against which you may have claimed a deduction. In case you fail to observe the lock-in period, the deductions that you availed can be officially cancelled. Here is the detailed information about the lock-in periods that need to be observed if you have claimed deduction against repayment of home loan principal amount. Lock-in periodThough there is no as such lock-in period for deduction claimed against interest payment on home loan as per section 24(b) or 80EE, the section 80C(5) (relating to repayment of principal) of the Income Tax Act specifies that if you sell your house within 5 years from the date of purchase, the deduction claimed on principal repayment during previous years gets revoked. In such a scenario, all deductions claimed for the home loan principal repayment under section 80C during the previous years also have to be clubbed and added to income of the year of sale, and be taxed depending on that only. In addition to the home loan principal amount, the stamp duty and registration fee paid for registration of property also qualifies for deduction under section 80C in the year of purchase. If you had claimed registration fee and stamp duty also as deduction, you need to observe 5-year lock-in in such cases too. The deduction on home loanIn case you take a home loan for buying or building a house, the capital repayment and interest paid on the loan qualify for deduction under separate income tax sections. While the principal repayment falls under the section 80C of the Income-tax Act, 1961 and has a total limit of Rs 1.5 lakh a year, the interest payment on home loan qualifies for deduction under section 24 (b) of the Act, with a total limit of Rs 2 lakh a year. There is an additional deduction of Rs 50,000 for interest payment on home loans under section 80EE for the first-time homebuyers.

NEW DELHI: Gratuity is a part of the salary, which the employee receives from his employer in return for the job/services offered by the employee to the organization. Gratuity is defined as a benefit plan and is one of the major after-job perks the employee receives from the employer after leaving the job. There are three main ways to calculate your gratuity balance: 1.) Through govt websiteThe government of India offers an online tool that helps in calculating the investment amount. This calculator computes the amount of Gratuity Pay with respect to the input values of basic pay as last drawn a monthly salary as on date is taken into account, DA - dearness allowance, Number of years and months served, the gratuity coverage of Indian Act 1972 and the commission on salary. Here is the direct link to calculate 2.) Ask your employerThe employer or the HR of the organization has the complete information of all the employees. If somebody wishes to get the information regarding their gratuity benefits along with the salary details. 3.) Calculate yourself using this formula Gratuity amount is calculated on the basis of the last drawn salary and tenure of service. This amount is calculated according to the given formula: Last drawn salary (basic salary plus dearness allowance) X number of completed years of service X 15/26 As per this formula, the time period of about six months or more is taken as one year. Thus, once a person completes completed five years and seven months with the organization, the entire time period is considered as six years while calculating the gratuity benefit. On the other hand, if the time period of the service is five years and five months while calculating the gratuity amount it will be counted as five years. An employer can, however, give higher gratuity than the amount under the prescribed formula.  What is the eligibility for gratuity?If you want to receive gratuity, it becomes compulsory that you have completed a minimum of 5 years of service with your organization. The gratuity is paid before the completion of 5 years of service if the employee becomes disabled due to an accident or disease or expires. Is the notice period considered for gratuity?Since your service for any organization is counted till the last day you work or the day you are relieved, so your notice period is also regarded in the time-frame while paying the gratuity. Can gratuity be received without resigning?To avail of gratuity, employees should be eligible for superannuation and should have resigned post-completion of 5 years with the same employer or company. What should I do if the company is not releasing gratuity?In case the employer denies an employee gratuity, the individual can file a complaint under Section 8 of the act, against the respective firm.

Though it was thrown open to the public eight years ago, investors started showing interest in the National Pension System (NPS) only two years ago. Almost 80% of the 4.39 lakh voluntary subscribers joined the scheme only in the past two years. Also, 75% of the 5.85 lakh corporate sector investors joined NPS in the past four years. Clearly, these investors have been attracted by the tax benefits offered on the scheme. Four years ago, it was announced that up to 10% of the basic salary put in the NPS would be tax free. The benefit under Section 80CCD(2d) led to a jump in the corporate NPS registrations. The number of subscribers shot up 83%: from 1.43 lakh in 2012-13 to 2.62 lakh in 2013-14. What is NPS?Two years ago, the government announced an additional tax deduction of `50,000 under Sec 80CCD(1b). The number of voluntary contributors shot up 148% from 86,774 to 2.15 lakh. It turned into a deluge after the 2016 Budget made 40% of the NPS corpus tax free, with the number of subscribers in the unorganised sector more than doubling to 4.39 lakh. This indicates that tax savings, define the flow of investments in India. However, many investors are unable to decide which pension fund they should invest in. The problem is further compounded by the fact that the NPS investments are spread across 2-3 fund classes. How to calculate NPS?So, we studied the blended returns of four different combinations of the equity, corporate debt and gilt funds. Ultrasafe investors are assumed to have put 60% in gilt funds, 40% in corporate bond funds and nothing in equity funds. A conservative investor would put 20% in stocks, 30% in corporate bonds and 50% in gilts. A balanced allocation would put 33.3% in each class of funds, while an aggressive investor would invest the maximum 50% in the equity fund, 30% in corporate bonds and 20% in gilts. Ultra safe investorsBond funds of the NPS have generated over 12% returns in the past one year, but the performance has not been good in recent months. The average G class gilt fund of the NPS has given 0.55% returns in the past six months. The change in the RBI stance on interest rates pushed up bond yields significantly in February, which led to a sharp decline in bond fund NAVs. Before they hit a speed bump, gilt and corporate bond funds had been on a roll. Rate cuts in 2015-16 were followed by demonetisation, which boosted the returns of gilt and corporate bond funds. Risk-averse investors who stayed away from equity funds and put their corpus in gilt and corporate bond funds have earned rich rewards. How to invest in NPSUnsurprisingly, the LIC Pension Fund is the best performing pension fund for this allocation. âTeam LIC has rich experience in the bond market and is perhaps the best suited to handle bond funds,â says a financial planner. The gilt funds of NPS usually invest in long-term bonds and are therefore very sensitive to interest rate changes. Going forward, the returns from gilt and corporate bond funds will be muted compared to the high returns in the past. Conservative investorsIn the long term, a 100% debt allocation is unlikely to beat inflation. This is why financial planners advise that at least some portion of the retirement corpus should be deployed in equities. Conservative investors in the NPS, who put 20% in equity funds and the rest in debt funds, have also earned good returns. Though the short-term performance has been pulled down by the debt portion, the medium- and long-term performances are quite attractive. Here too, LIC Pension Fund is the best performer because 80% of the corpus is in debt. It has generated SIP returns of 10.25% in the past 3 years. NPS funds for government employees also follow a conservative allocation, with a 15% cap on equity exposure. How to apply for national pension scheme?These funds have also done fairly well, beating the 100% debt-based EPF by almost 200-225 basis points in the past five years. Incidentally, the LIC Pension Fund for Central Government employees is the best performer in that category. Debt-oriented hybrid mutual funds, also known as monthly income plans, have given similar returns. However, this performance may not be sustained in future. The equity markets could correct and the debt investments might also give muted returns. Balanced investorsBalanced investors who spread their investments equally across all three fund classes have done better than the ultra-safe and conservative investors. The twin rallies in bonds and equities have helped balanced portfolios churn out impressive returns. Though debt funds slipped in the short term, the spectacular performance of equity funds pulled up the overall returns. Reliance Capital Pension Fund is the best performer in the past six months with 4.03% returns, but it is Kotak Pension Fund that has delivered the most impressive numbers over the long term. Its three-year SIP returns are 10.39% while five-year SIP returns are 11.22%. For investors above 40, the balanced allocation closely mirrors the Moderate Lifecycle Fund. This fund puts 50% of the corpus in equities and reduces the equity exposure by 2% every year after the investor turns 35. By the age of 43, the allocation to equities is down to 34%. However, some financial planners argue that since retirement is still 15-16 years away, a 42-43-year olds should not reduce the equity exposure to 34-35%. But it is prudent to start reducing the risk in the portfolio as one grows older. Aggressive investorsAggressive investors, who put the maximum 50% in equity funds and the rest in gilt and corporate bond funds have earned the highest returns, with stock markets touching their all-time highs. Kotak Pension Fund gave 16.3% returns in the past year. The best performing UTI Retirement Solutions has given SIP returns of 11.78% in five years. Though equity exposure has been capped at 50%, young investors can put in up to 75% of the corpus in equities if they opt for the Aggressive Lifecycle Fund. It was introduced late last year, (along with a Conservative Lifecycle Fund that put only 25% in equities), and investors who opted for it earned an average 10.8% in the past 6 months. But the equity allocation of the Aggressive Lifecycle Fund starts reducing by 4% after the investor turns 35. The reduction slows down to 3% a year after he turns 45. Even so, by the late 40s, his allocation to equities is not very different from the Moderate Lifecycle Fund. Critics say investors should be allowed to invest more in equities if they want.

The new Goods and Services Tax (GST) has changed the way businesses use to bill their clients and or customers. If you are one those wondering how to calculate GST returns, here is a step by step guide for you: Step 1: The first step is to find the exact slab rate for the goods or services under the GST Act. To find GST Rate, you will have to determine the type of supply item, i.e., whether is it a good or a service. If the supply is a good, find the HSN Code and if the transaction involves the supply of a service, then find the SAC Code.  Here's how to find GST HSN and SAC codeOnce you know the HSN or SAC Code, then find out under which slab of GST tax rate the supply fits into. The GST Council has created 5 different slab rates at NIL/0%, 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% for both goods and services. Click here to find the list of goods and service tax ratesStep 2: Once you know the GST rate, next find out the applicability of IGST or CGST and SGST. To do so, you need to determine the place of supply first. Mostly, the place where the supply of goods or services was done would be the address where the goods or the service was provided. But in case of e-commerce or OIDAR services, the determination of the place of supply is a more complex issue. Step 3: Under GST rule, the supplier of the goods or service can collect tax from the recipient and remit the same to the government. However, there are some services like 'reverse charge services', where the recipient is made liable for payment of GST. Step 4: According to new GST rules, suppliers must maintain extensive accounts, records and file 3 GST forms in a month. However, small businesses having a turnover of less than Rs 75 lakhs, can enrol under the GST Composition Scheme and pay a flat GST based on their aggregate turnover. You should check whether your supplier is enrolled under GST Composition Scheme or not. Step 5: Next is to find out the type of transactions, for example - Business to Business; Business to Consumer where the value of supply is more than Rs 2.5 lakhs; or Business to Consumer where the value of supply is less than Rs 2.5 lakhs.  How to compute GST return?This can be done by subtracting the comprehensive GST you have paid on your purchases and expenses (available on the box 14 on your return) from the holistic GST you have received from your sales and income (available on the box 10 on your return). How many GST returns are available to claim?A regular business can file either monthly returns or annual returns under GST. The total of this comes to around 26 returns in a single financial year. How to calculate late fees for GST?There is a penalty of 5% of the balance owing plus the 1% of your balance owing for each full month your return is late, subject to a maximum of 12-month time-period. Is GST computed on MRP?Yes, MRP or maximum retail price is inclusive of all taxes including GST too. No retailer can charge GST over and above the MRP.

Eliminates cascading effect of taxGST has subsumed more than a dozen taxes that existed before the new tax regime. This helps in eliminating the cascading effect of taxes. Cascading effect refers to the situation where a taxpayer needs to pay taxes on taxes. Higher threshold of taxpayersUnder the previous taxation system, any business with a turnover of more than Rs 5 lakh (in most states) was liable to pay VAT. Also, service tax was exempted for service providers with a turnover of less than Rs 10 lakh. Under GST regime, however, this threshold has been increased to Rs 20 lakh, which exempts many small traders and service providers. Small businessesOver a period of time, government has provided reliefs to small businessmen and taxpayers as far as rate of tax and compliance of filing tax is concerned. Under GST, small businesses (with a turnover of Rs 20 to 75 lakh) can benefit as it gives an option to lower taxes by utilizing the Composition scheme. This move has brought down the tax and compliance burden on many small businesses. Simpler and Lesser Number of CompliancesCompliance will be simpler through the harmonisation of tax rates, procedures, and laws. Synergies and efficiencies are expected across the board thanks to common formats/forms, common definitions, and common interface via the GST portal. Inter-state disputes such as those on e-commerce taxation and entry tax that currently prevail will no longer cause concerns, while multiple taxation on the same transactions will also be removed. Compliance costs will also reduce as a result. The previous tax regime had service tax and VAT, and they both had their own compliances and returns. GST will merge them and lower the number of returns as well as the time spent on tax compliances. GST has around 11 returns under it. Four of them are basic returns that are applicable to all taxable entities under GST. Although the number of returns could increase, the main GSTR-1 shall be manually populated, while GSTR-2, GSTR-3, AND GSTR-4 shall be auto-populated.

GSTR-1 is a monthly or quarterly return to be filed by regular dealers, the return of which is divided into 13 sections. It is the base document upon which the entire compliance structure of GST is based. For traders with turnover upto Rs 1.5 crore annually, GSTR-1 needs to be filed on quarterly basis while that for traders having turnover above that needs to be filed every month. The late fee for filing GSTR-1 is Rs 50 per day after the due date, and Rs 20, in case of nil returns. Once GSTR-1 return is filed, a trader does not need to pay any tax immediately. The tax has to be paid at the time of filing GSTR-3B (until March 2018). Composition dealers need not file GSTR-1. Such traders need to file GSTR-4 every quarter. GSTR-1 is filed in FORM GSTR-1. The various details included in GSTR-1 are: (i) Invoice wise details of Inter-State and Intra-State supplies made to registered persons and Inter-State supplies with invoice value more than two and a half lakh rupees made to unregistered persons. (ii) Consolidated details of Intra-State supplies made to unregistered persons for each rate of tax and State wise Inter-State supplies with invoice value upto two and a half lakh rupees made to unregistered persons for each rate of tax. (iii) Debit and Credit notes, if any, issued during the month for invoices issued previously.  What is meant by GSTR1?Simply put, GSTR1 is a monthly statement of outward supplies to be crafted by all normal and casual registered taxpaying individuals who are engaged in outward supplying of goods and services and possess information related to these outward supplies. Is it mandatory to file GSTR1?Business owners who have a comprehensive income of more than Rs 2,50,000 are required compulsorily to file income tax returns under GSTR1. How do GSTR1 and GSTR2 differ from each other?While GSTR1 is the monthly statement of outward supplies of goods or services filed by registered individuals, the GSTR2 return reflects the accrual of the input tax credit from the inputs collected at some point of the prior month. What is the late fee for GSTR1?The penalty or the late fee for not filing GSTR1 is Rs 200 per day that includes Rs 100 for CGST Act and Rs 100 for SGST Act.
