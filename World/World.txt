WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden virtually doomed the Senate impeachment trial of his predecessor Donald Trump by acknowledging Democrats do not have enough votes in the chamber to convict the former President. Biden's remarks came even as the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives formally delivered to the Senate (which is also now Democrat-controlled despite being tied at 50-50) an article of impeachment charging Donald Trump with inciting the deadly insurrection at the Capitol. "The Senate has changed since I was there, but it hasn't changed that much," Biden said in remarks to CNN at the very moment Democratic impeachment team from the House were delivering the article, implicitly conceding the outcome may not result in conviction. He however said the trial was necessary to bring about accountability and it would be worse if it did not happen. The prelude confirmed the growing belief that the impeachment trial would largely be a political spectacle. Convicting the former President requires a 2/3rd majority of those present and voting in the 100-member Senate, and Republican lawmakers, despite the signal from the party establishment and leadership that they were free to vote according to their conscience, have begun to shy away from committing to do so for fear of being defeated in party primaries by surrogates of the former President, who still wields considerable support in his base. As per the schedule agreed upon by Senate Democrat and Republican leadership, Senators will be sworn in as jurors Tuesday, when Trump will receive the official summons. But the official trial proceedings will begin only in the week of February 8. The trial will be presided over by Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy, who is the president pro tempore and the most senior Democrat in the chamber, and not by the US Chief Justice John Roberts (who presided over the first impeachment) or by vice-president Kamala Harris, who is the constitutionally-designated President of the Senate. Very few Republican Senators have committed to vote for Trump's conviction though the party establishment would like to put the former President out of politics and rescue the GOP from the so-called insurgents who've hijacked it. Among those who oppose the impeachment is former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who told Fox News, âThey beat him up before he was in office, they beat him while he was in office, now theyâre beating him up after heâs left office. Give the man a break.â Trump meanwhile formally established an "Office of the Former President," to show that he is not going fading away into the Florida sun. Located in Palm Beach, the office will be run by his former White House aides and "will be responsible for managing President Trumpâs correspondence, public statements, appearances, and official activities," a statement from his office said, adding, "President Trump will always and forever be a champion for the American people." The former President has all but disappeared from public view, virtually unheard of without his social media megaphone and without the cameras that trail the most powerful office in the world. Images from Florida showed him playing golf over the weekend wearing a red MAGA cap. The former President's surrogates have denied reports that he plans to launch an outfit called the "Patriot Party" but Trump himself said last week that âWeâll do something, but not just yet.â

Rome: Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte resigned Tuesday in the hope of forming a new government after weeks of turmoil in his ruling coalition, leaving Italy rudderless as it battles the deadly coronavirus pandemic.  He tendered his resignation to President Sergio Mattarella, the ultimate arbiter of Italian political crises, who invited him to stay on in a caretaker capacity pending discussions on what happens next.  The uneasy coalition that has led Italy since September 2019 was fatally weakened earlier this month by the withdrawal of former premier Matteo Renzi's small but crucial Italia Viva party.  Ahead of a key vote in parliament this week that he looked set to lose, Conte informed his cabinet on Tuesday that he would quit in what supporters said was a move to form a new government.  After the meeting with Mattarella, a spokesman for the president said he "reserves the right to decide (what to do next) and invited the government to stay in office in a caretaker capacity".  Mattarella will open discussions with party leaders on Wednesday afternoon which are likely to lead into Thursday -- leaving a vacuum at the top of the eurozone's third largest economy at a crucial time.  Italy was the first European country to face the full force of the Covid-19 pandemic and has since suffered badly, with the economy plunged into recession and deaths still rising by around 400 a day.  Parts of the country remain under partial lockdown, the vaccination programme has slowed and a deadline is looming to agree plans to spend billions of euros in European Union recovery funds.  Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, one of the leaders of the populist Five Star Movement (M5S), the largest in parliament, earlier said it was time to rally around Conte.  "The country is going through one of its worst ever periods due to the pandemic," he tweeted late Monday. "Now we need unity, we all have to gather around Giuseppe Conte."  - New mandate - Conte's government had been on the verge of collapse since Renzi pulled out on January 13 in a row over the premier's handling of the pandemic.  Renzi in particular warned he risked wasting the EU funds with a 220-billion-euro ($267 billion) spending plan that he said failed to address Italy's long-term structural issues.  The prime minister survived a vote of confidence in parliament last week but failed to secure an overall majority in the upper house, the Senate.  Despite days of talks with senators to seek their support, he looked set to lose a crucial vote on judicial reform in the coming days.  "Conte's calculation is that by moving early, and thereby avoiding a humiliating defeat in the Senate later this week, he would increase his chances of securing a mandate from Mattarella to form a new government," noted Wolfango Piccoli of the Teneo consultancy.  Nicola Zingaretti, leader of the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), the other main partner in the coalition, so far is backing Conte.  He tweeted that he was "with Conte for a new government that is clearly pro-European and supported by a broad parliamentary base".  - Ditch Conte? - But other lawmakers will be needed to form a viable new government -- and "it is currently unclear whether Conte can succeed in such an effort", Piccoli noted.  If he cannot, the M5S and PD could "ditch Conte and look for another candidate" to head a new coalition government.  They are keen to avoid snap elections, which opinion polls suggest would lead to victory for the centre-right coalition comprising billionaire former premier Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia and Matteo Salvini's far-right League party.  Conte, a once obscure law professor, has proved himself remarkably adept at navigating the famously choppy waters of Italian politics.  Since the 2018 elections he has been at the helm of two governments of different political shades.  The first was a fractious and unashamedly populist coalition between M5S and Salvini's League, which ended when the latter pulled out in August 2019.  Conte went on to preside over another unlikely coalition -- the so-called Conte II government -- between M5S and the PD, two former sworn enemies.

MUMBAI: Nearly a fortnight after Elon Muskâs Tesla entered India on January 8, his SpaceX on Sunday night broke a world space record by launching 143 satellites in quick succession, beating Indiaâs record of deploying 104 satellites in February 2017. The launch vehicle for the SpaceX record-breaking flight was the Falcon 9 and the mission was designated as Transporter-1. The lift-off at Cape Canaveral in Florida was at 8.31pm IST. At one point, the rocket flew over India and its signal was picked up by Isroâs Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network at Bengaluru. The launch marks the first dedicated mission for SpaceXâs SmallSat Rideshare Program, which enables small-satellite customers to book a ride to orbit with SpaceX directly. The 143 satellites launched on Sunday included commercial and government CubeSats, microsats, what are known as orbiter transfer vehicles and 10 Starlink satellites â the maximum number of spacecraft ever to be deployed in a single mission. This batch of Starlink satellites was the first in the constellation to be placed in the polar orbit. The nearly 90-minute deployment sequence of the satellites having different roles was nail-biting because they separated in a span of a few seconds and a minute. Onboard was also a spacecraft belonging to Nasa. With these satellites, SpaceX aims to provide near-global broadband internet coverage all over the world by 2021. About 10 minutes after lift-off, SpaceX recovered the first stage once again on the âOf Course I Still Love Youâ drone ship stationed in the Atlantic Ocean. Then, about an hour after liftoff, the payloads started deploying over the course of about 90 minutes. According to sources, SpaceX offered a very low price of $15,000 per kilogram for each satellite to be delivered to a polar sun-synchronous orbit.

WASHINGTON: Donald Trump opened an office in Florida on Monday that will handle his duties as a former US president and seek to further his administration's agenda. "The Office will be responsible for managing President Trump's correspondence, public statements, appearances, and official activities to advance the interests of the United States and to carry on the agenda of the Trump Administration through advocacy, organizing, and public activism," a statement said. The announcement came on the same day the House of Representatives delivered to the Senate an impeachment article charging Trump with inciting insurrection in a speech to supporters before the deadly attack on the Capitol on January 6. The Senate trial is expected to start on February 9. In farewell remarks on his last day as president last Wednesday, Trump told supporters: "We will be back in some form." Trump has made no public appearances since flying that day to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. Before leaving office, Trump talked with associates about forming a political party called the "Patriot Party," the Wall Street Journal reported. Before leaving office, he pursued unsuccessful legal challenges to overturn his November 3 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden, falsely claiming there had been widespread electoral fraud.

California lifts virus stay-at-home orders, curfew statewide

SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA: California lifted regional stay-at-home orders across the state Monday in response to improving coronavirus conditions, returning the state to a system of county-by-county restrictions. The order had been in place in the San Francisco Bay Area, San Joaquin Valley and Southern California, covering the majority of the state's counties. The change will allow businesses such as restaurants to resume outdoor operations in many areas, though local officials could choose to continue stricter rules. The state is also lifting a 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. ``Together, we changed our activities knowing our short-term sacrifices would lead to longer-term gains. Covid-19 is still here and still deadly, so our work is not over, but it's important to recognize our collective actions saved lives and we are turning a critical corner,`` Dr. Tomas Aragon, the state's public health director, said in a statement. Gov. Gavin Newsom was expected to address the public later Monday. Public officials in some of California's major cities and counties indicated they could soon lift local restrictions. ``We will be moving forward with some limited re-openings, including outdoor dining and personal services,'' San Francisco Mayor London Breed said in a tweet. Orange County planned to lift some restrictions as well, said Jessica Good, a spokesperson for the county health agency. In Los Angeles County, home to 10 million people, Republican Supervisor Kathryn Barger expressed support for opening outdoor dining, personal care services and other industries and said the state must balance public health with ``devastating social, emotional and economic impacts of this virus.'' Los Angeles County public health officials are expected to hold a briefing later Monday. The state's decision came amid improving trends in California's rate of infections, hospitalizations and intensive care unit capacity as well as vaccinations. Newsom, a Democrat, imposed the stay-at-home order in December as coronavirus cases worsened. Under the system, a multi-county region had to shut down most businesses and order people to stay home if ICU capacity dropped below 15%. An 11-county Northern California region was never under the order and the Greater Sacramento Region exited the order last week. The state makes its decisions based on four-week projections showing ICU capacity improving, but officials have not disclosed the data behind the forecasts. During the weekend, San Francisco Bay Area ICU capacity surged to 23% while the San Joaquin Valley agricultural region increased to 1.3%, its first time above zero. The huge Southern California region, the most populous, remains at zero ICU capacity. Republicans said Newsom was relaxing the rules in response to political pressure and the threat of a recall. Republican organizers have until mid-March to gather 1.5 million signatures to force a recall against Newsom, who is halfway through his first term. ``This Governor's decisions have never been based on science. Him re-opening our state is not an attempt to help working Californians, but rather an attempt to counter the Recall Movement. It's sad and pathetic,`` California Republican Party Chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson tweeted. Early last year, the state developed a system of color-coded tiers that dictated the level of restrictions on businesses and individuals based on virus conditions in each of California's 58 counties. Most counties will now go back to the most restrictive purple tier, which allows for outdoor dining, hair and nail salons to be open, and outdoor church services. Bars that only serve beverages cannot be open. The county-by-county tier system uses various metrics to determine the risk of community transmission and apply a color code _ purple, red, orange or yellow _ which correspond to widespread, substantial, moderate and minimal, respectively. As of the weekend, California has had more than 3.1 million confirmed Covid-19 cases and 36,790 deaths, according to the state's public health website.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Cabinet has decided to table a bill in Parliament to amend the Constitution for holding the Senate elections through open vote. The decision was taken during the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, presided over by Prime Minister Imran Khan. âThe government wants the (Senate) polls to be held in a transparent manner and without horse-trading. This is why we want Senate polls to be held through an open ballot,â Information Minister Shibli Faraz told the media after the meeting. He said that in the past, money was used in Senate elections and votes were bought making the House election a mockery. He asked what was the use of an upper house in which people come through purchasing of votes. Faraz also said that people opposing the proposed move are forgetting that their own party had demanded open ballot in the past. âThe government will present a constitutional amendment bill in the parliament so that Senate polls are held through open ballot,â he said. Already the government petitioned to the Supreme Court, seeking direction to hold the upcoming Senate elections through open ballot. The decision is pending. Meanwhile, Dawn newspaper quoted a Cabinet member as saying that Prime Minister Khan tasked his advisor parliamentary affairs Babar Awan to table a bill in the National Assembly for holding Senate elections through open ballot when the adviser was giving a briefing on the status of the government's reference in the Supreme Court. Awan said the government had already laid two bills â Constitution Amendment Bill and Electoral Reforms Bill â in Parliament on the basis of which desired legislation could be done for an open ballot. The Cabinet member said Awan had called a meeting of his ministry and its legislation branch to devise a roadmap on how to proceed with the matter in Parliament. It has been proposed that since Senate polls could not be held through show of hand because every voter has to show his preference in the ballot paper. Therefore, to ensure open identity of the voter, the voter should be required to mention his name on the back side of the ballot paper, according to Dawn newspaper. Senate elections will be held in the first half of next month and prime minister Khan's ruling Pakistan Tehreek-I-Insaf is wary that its own members may vote a gay party policy, according to Opposition parties that are against the move.

TOKYO: Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga apologised on Wednesday after lawmakers from his ruling coalition visited night clubs despite his government's call for people to avoid unnecessary outings to curb the spread of Covid-19. The news is another headache for Suga whose approval rating has tumbled due to dissatisfaction with his handling of the pandemic, which critics have called too slow and inconsistent. "I'm terribly sorry that this happened when we are asking people not to eat out after 8pm and to avoid non-essential, non-urgent outings," Suga told parliament. "Each lawmaker should behave to gain the public's understanding." Japan this month issued a state of emergency in Tokyo and other areas to tame a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases. The measure includes a request for restaurants and bars to close by 8pm although there are currently no penalties for non-compliance. "My behaviour was careless at a time when we are asking people to be patient," Jun Matsumoto, a senior lawmaker from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, told reporters. Matsumoto was speaking following a Daily Shincho magazine report that he had visited two night clubs in Tokyo's posh Ginza district after dining at an Italian restaurant last Monday. Kiyohiko Toyama, a lawmaker from the coalition's junior partner Komeito, also apologised after tabloid Shukan Bunshun reported he had visited a high-end night club in Ginza until late last Friday. Twitter users voiced their frustration. "It is just a matter of time before public anger explodes. I don't want a blanket cash-payout of 100,000 yen ($965), I want them to quit! " wrote one user. "They are really stupid. Don't they think about what they are doing and how the public sees them? If they don't, they are unqualified to represent the public," said another.

NEW YORK: A US bankruptcy judge has approved a $17 million payout to dozens of women who accused jailed movie producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual abuse. Weinstein, 68, was sentenced to 23 years in prison last year after being convicted of rape and sexual assault. Delaware Judge Mary Walrath on Monday agreed to the Weinstein Company's liquidation plan, which sets aside the payment. She overruled the objections of several of Weinstein's victims who complained that the settlement prevented them from pursuing other legal claims. The money will be split between 37 women, meaning they are each likely to receive six-figure sums. Lawyers representing some victims had earlier denounced the proposed settlement as insufficient. Eight accusers who rejected the settlement will be able to sue the ex-Hollywood mogul later. Weinstein was found guilty in February 2020 of a criminal sexual act in the first degree and rape in the third degree in a landmark verdict for the #MeToo movement. His sentence capped a remarkable downfall for the "Pulp Fiction" producer who was accused of years of vile predatory behavior by almost 90 women, including Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek. The Weinstein Company declared bankruptcy in March 2018 after the avalanche of claims. Lantern Capital, later renamed Spyglass Media Group, bought its assets for $289 million. Weinstein is also awaiting trial in Los Angeles on rape and sexual assault charges involving five women.

Ottawa residents seek to dump Trump street name

OTTAWA: Residents of an Ottawa neighborhood are looking to distance themselves from Donald Trump by renaming their street, which bears his name -- once a source of intrigue, but now an embarrassment. Trump Avenue on the Canadian capital's west side is lined with brick homes, each with two-car garages and kids playing hockey in driveways. The Central Park neighborhood, known for New York City-themed street names, was built in the late 1990s -- long before a certain Big Apple real estate mogul entered politics. There's also a Madison Park, Bloomingdale Street, Manhattan Crescent, and Staten Way in the area. Bonnie Bowering moved here in 2008. "When I used to tell people I live on Trump Avenue and I would add, 'Yes, it is The Donald,' people would smirk, some offered sympathies, that sort of thing," she told AFP. "But now -- after he's undermined democracy, and incited an insurrection, a violent attack on the US Capitol -- it's time to change our street name," she said. "Trump doesn't deserve the honor and I think it's inappropriate to have a street named after him in Canada's capital." Ottawa city councilor Riley Brockington started gathering support for the name change from people who live on the street this week. Some residents had been petitioning the city for years to change it, but Brockington resisted, saying he feared offending Trump while he was in office. "I was concerned that there might be ramifications against Canada, that Trump would take punitive measures if word got out that Canada's national capital wanted to take his name off a street sign," Brockington said. "With his exit from the White House, I felt now was a good time to try it." At least 50 percent of residents must agree to the name change to trigger a process that would take several months. That's not soon enough for Diane Hosker, who was out walking her dog Tuesday afternoon. "It was a novelty at first, a fun way to start off a conversation when you told people where you lived," she said. "Now it's an embarrassment." "The man's an idiot and I don't like his brand of politics," she added. Nearby, a father stuck his head out of his front door to call his son in from the cold, and nodded in agreement. Changing the street's name would require new signage, but also new maps and postal addresses for 62 homes. And then there's the matter of selecting a new name. Most other New York names are already taken in Ottawa, and numbered street names such as Fifth Avenue won't do. "We already have one of those in Ottawa," Bowering explained. "I hope we end up with a name that everybody is happy with," she concluded. "Of course, some people say 'Anything would be better.'"

LONDON: As the United Kingdom on Tuesday crossed the grim milestone of 100,000 deaths due to Covid-19, Prime Minister Boris Johnson extended condolences to the kin of victims and said it was hard to "compute the sorrow contained in the grim statistic". Johnson during a Covid-19 briefing on Tuesday said that he and his government take "full responsibility" for the decisions taken by him and his Cabinet to curb the spread of the virus and reduce the fatalities due to the pathogen. The British Prime Minister further said that he "was sorry for every life that has been lost" stating that the government did everything they could possibly do. "I am sorry to have to tell you that today the number of deaths recorded from Covid in the UK has surpassed 100,000, and it is hard to compute the sorrow contained in that grim statistic. The years of life lost, the family gatherings not attended and, for so many relatives, the missed chance even to say goodbye," Johnson said during a briefing on Tuesday. He added, "I offer my deepest condolences to everyone who has lost a loved one; fathers and mothers; brothers and sisters; sons and daughters and the many grandparents who have been taken... I am deeply sorry for every life that has been lost and of course, as Prime Minister, I take full responsibility for everything the government has done. What I can tell you is that we truly did everything we could and continue to do everything we can do." The British Prime Minister pledged that when the country "comes through" this crisis, the British public would come together and remember "everyone we lost". "To all those who grieve, we make this pledge: that when we have come through this crisis, we will come together as a nation to remember everyone we lost, and to honour the selfless heroism of all those on the front line who gave their lives to save others," he said. "We will remember the courage of countless working people -- not just our amazing NHS and care workers, but shop workers, transport staff, pharmacists, teachers, police, armed forces emergency services and many others - who kept our country going during our biggest crisis since the Second World War," he added. According to Sputnik, the UK vaccination campaign started on December 8 and as of Tuesday, around 6.5 million people have received at least one vaccine dose. The vaccination is currently open to five priority groups, including people over 80 years old, some people over 70, clinically vulnerable persons, personnel of care homes, and medical workers. There are currently three authorised vaccines in the United Kingdom -- the domestically-made AstraZeneca, the US-German Pfizer/BioNTech, and the one developed by US company Moderna. Johnson called for lessons to be learnt and reflect on once "those vaccines have finally freed us" and added that the best "and most important thing" the people can all do to honour the memory of those who have died from Covid-19 is to "work together with ever greater resolve to defeat this disease." As per the latest update by Johns Hopkins University, the United Kingdom has over 3.7 million Covid-19 cases and 100,359 deaths from the deadly virus across the country.

WASHINGTON: He's gone, he's golfing, but from his palm lined Florida hideaway Donald Trump is also plotting revenge. If many Americans -- perhaps discreetly including a number of senior Republicans -- wished Trump would just disappear at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, they're in for a sore disappointment. As an impeachment trial clanks into gear in Washington, the disgraced ex-president is making clear to Republican senators that they need to remember he is a major force. An announcement on Monday that he was opening "the Office of the Former President" in his new hometown reminded them. "President Trump will always and forever be a champion for the American People," the statement said. Senators are considering Trump's fate in the first impeachment trial ever of a former president and -- after last year's version -- the first time a president has been twice impeached at all. But Trump -- winner of 74 million votes in his defeat to Biden on November 3 and reportedly sitting on some $70 million in campaign funds -- wants Republican senators to consider their own futures before they dare cross him. At least 17 Republicans would need to join the 50 Senate Democrats for a conviction in his trial. Every day that goes by, this appears less likely. On Tuesday, a Republican senator's motion to declare the trial unconstitutional got support from all but five Republicans, the strongest indication yet that a bipartisan conviction is dead on arrival. Yes, a lot of Republican lawmakers are furious at Trump's incitement of a crowd to march on Congress on January 6 in a bid to interrupt certification of President Joe Biden's election win. But Republicans also want to win back the House of Representatives and Senate in the 2022 midterm elections and the White House in 2024. And for now at least, being pro-Trump is arguably the best way to achieve this. According to a January Washington Post-ABC News poll, nearly six in 10 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents believe the party needs to remain under Trump's leadership. Trump's main way of applying pressure while out of office is to threaten disloyal legislators with support for their challengers in party primary votes ahead of the 2022 midterms. Trump's endorsement on Monday of his former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders in her bid to become governor of Arkansas was a first flexing of political muscle. Sanders is competing with more senior party officials in the state for the shot at high office. But in the race to be the most loyal Trump acolyte, she already wins hands down and can expect to reap the rewards. For those who have failed the Trump purity test, nervous days await. During the four years of his presidency, Trump ground down almost any internal opposition. So he was stung by the outpouring of criticism over his actions on January 6 and he'd like revenge.

He is loyally attacking the impeachment trial as a "waste of time" and "vengeance from the radical left." But is this enough? Rubio did not support Trump's last-minute attempts to challenge congressional certification of Biden's victory, putting him in the potential crosshairs. Speculation is rife that Rubio's seat could be challenged in the 2022 primary by none other than Ivanka Trump, the ex-president's ambitious daughter and former White House advisor.

Coronavirus: 100 million Covid-19 cases worldwide

WASHINGTON: More than 100 million Covid-19 cases have now been recorded worldwide, according to an AFP tally on Tuesday, as newly-inaugurated President Joe Biden pledged to ramp up the United States's struggling vaccine program. The number of cases, compiled from data provided by national health agencies, represents just a fraction of the real infections as the coronavirus has spread around the globe.   The United States, which passed 25 million confirmed cases last weekend, remains the country with the largest outbreak -- and the largest death toll of over 420,000. Biden is seeking to turn around the fight against the virus, which took a ferocious grip on the country during Donald Trump's presidency when the risks were downplayed and officials gave mixed messages on mask-wearing other safety measures. Biden said vaccinating the entire US population was a daunting challenge, and the program inherited from the Trump administration "was in worse shape than we anticipated or expected." "This is a war-time undertaking. It's not hyperbole," he said, announcing the US was buying an additional 200 million doses and will have enough to vaccinate 300 million Americans -- virtually the entire population -- by early fall. In another day of grim milestones, Britain surged past 100,000 Covid-19 deaths, and other European nations looked to tighten their borders, hoping to keep out new, more transmissible virus strains. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was "hard to compute" the loss felt by British families after his country became the first European country to surpass 100,000 Covid-19 deaths. But he said his government, which faced criticism over its initial response to the outbreak, "did everything that we could to minimize suffering and minimize loss of life." According to the London Times, the UK government will announce Wednesday that British travellers must quarantine in hotels near airports for 10 days after returning from 30 high-risk countries, mostly in South America and Southern Africa. Neighboring Ireland said Tuesday it would enact mandatory travel quarantines for the first time, as well extending its third national lockdown until March 5. Among other European nations looking to strengthen border controls was Germany, which said it is considering almost completely halting flights into the country. "The danger from the numerous virus mutations forces us to consider drastic measures," Interior Minister Horst Seehofer told the Bild newspaper. Iceland meanwhile started to issue vaccination certificates to ease travel for those who have had both required doses. The new measures came as anger rises over grinding anti-coronavirus restrictions, with the Netherlands rocked by nightly riots since it imposed a curfew on Saturday. More than 400 people were arrested after the worst unrest to hit the country in four decades, but the Dutch government said it would not back down. "You don't capitulate to people who smash shop windows," Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra said, calling the rioters "scum." Israeli police also clashed with protesters, arresting 14 people after ultra-Orthodox Jews demonstrated against lockdown measures. With the global death toll at 2.1 million, the world has looked to vaccines to break the gloom, but bickering over access to doses has intensified. Tensions have in particular mounted between the European Union and pharmaceutical firms over delays to deliveries. "Europe invested billions to help develop the world's first Covid-19 vaccines," EU chief Ursula von der Leyen told the virtual World Economic Forum (WEF). "And now, the companies must deliver. They must honor their obligations." Europe's vaccination campaign stumbled after British-Swedish drugs company AstraZeneca warned it would not be able to meet promised targets on EU shipments -- a week after US group Pfizer said it was also delaying delivery volumes. AstraZeneca's CEO insisted Tuesday that the company was not selling vaccines ordered by the EU to other countries at a profit. The widening gap for vaccine supplies between rich and poor countries led both South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to lash out at "vaccine nationalism." Ramaphosa told the WEF that low- and middle-income countries were being shouldered aside by wealthier nations able to acquire "up to four times what their population needs." The row over access to vaccines at the WEF -- normally held at the Swiss ski resort of Davos -- comes as the pandemic compounds economic inequality. Despite Lebanon being under one of the world's strictest lockdowns, father-of-six Omar Qarhani told AFP he was still selling vegetables on the side of a road in Tripoli because he is desperate to support his family. "I'm not scared of corona -- what scares me is being in need and poverty," he said. The IMF now predicts a "cumulative output loss" of $22 trillion -- the equivalent of the entire US economy -- over 2020-25. Nevertheless, optimism that vaccines will bring the pandemic under control and allow economic activity to resume, coupled with stimulus in major economies, boosted the IMF's growth forecast this year to 5.5 percent.

MUMBAI: The steps that were underway, by the Trump administration to rescind the employment authorisation program, for certain categories of spouses of H-1B visa holders, is history. Nearly a lakh Indian spouses can now breathe a sigh of relief. Way back in February 2019, when the Trump administration began to take concrete steps towards rescinding this employment authorisation program, US Vice-President Kamala Harris (who was then a Senator) had tweeted, âThis is outrageous and will force immigrant women who are doctors, nurses, scientists and academics among others to abandon their professional careers.

In other words, it was in its final stages of a roll-out. Soon after the Biden administration stepped in, it stayed for a 60-day period, subject to further extensions, various proposed policies including the proposal to rescind the employment authorisation program. Now, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has formally withdrawn this proposed rule. Spouses of H-1B workers are given an H-4 visa. Only in certain cases, such as where the H-1B visa recipient is on track for a green card or where the H-1B visa recipient has got an extension beyond the permitted six years, could the H-4 spouse apply for an employment authorisation document. To take care of the decades-long green card backlog for certain sections, such as applicants from India, the Obama administration in 2015 had introduced the âH-4 Employment Authorization Document (EAD) rule.â Given that the expected wait time for Indians caught in the backlog of the employment-based green card for EB-2 and EB-3 (skilled category) runs to 84 years, according to a CATO Institute study â the EAD program proved to be very useful, especially for families struggling to survive on a single income. According to the latest available official data, up to December, 2017, nearly 84,360 Indian spouses (largely wives) held an EAD (this was 93% of the total EADs issued). The number of such Indian spouses is now estimated to be over a lakh. The EAD program meant more than financial freedom by enabling them to take up jobs or be self-employed, as the work authorisation also enabled spouses to obtain a social security number, open a bank account and get a driving license. SaveH4EAD, a group that started in December 2017, which currently has an outreach of several thousands has tweeted, âAfter years of advocacy, meeting Congress members, DHS/OMB and collecting irrefutable data on value-add of H4-EAD not only to economy but also to provide life of dignity to thousands of immigrants, we are pleased to announce that the new administration has withdrawn regulation to help #SaveH4EAD.â After years of advocacy, meeting congress members, DHS/OMB & collecting irrefutable data on value add of H4EAD notâ¦ https://t.co/dbrmItHazw— Save H4EAD (@SaveH4EADs) 1611703268000TOI has in the past covered the efforts of this group and had narrated how the American dream for many families would be shattered, if the EAD program came to an end. Plans to return or migrate elsewhere emerge for over 80,000 Indian families in USThe H4-EAD program has been involved in a long-drawn lawsuit filed by Save Jobs USA, which states that the EAD program takes away American jobs. Lately delays in getting the EAD extensions in a timely manner, has led to many H-4 visa holders filing lawsuits across the country. The next step according to SaveH4EAD is to streamline the process so that no one loses their jobs owing to processing delays. Todd Schulte, President of FWD.us, a bipartisan political organisation, whose founders include Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and others stated, âWe commend the Biden-Harris Administration for taking immediate action to turn the page from the Trump-Pence Administrationâs disastrous immigration policies, and to do right by more than 100,000 hardworking immigrants who are contributing to the United States every single day in the midst of a deadly pandemic. Allowing H-4 visa holders the ability to continue working and providing for their families has profound, life-changing effects for these individuals and our communities. Roughly 93 percent are women, and many are working in essential roles that are key to supporting our nationâs economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.â âAt the end of the day, there is no successful economic or public health recovery without bold action from lawmakers to protect immigrant essential workers and keep immigrant families safe and together. Congress must work together to immediately pass the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, which would formalize work authorization for H-4 visa holders, create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrant essential workers, and address the bureaucratic backlogs that plague our broken immigration system,â added Schulte.

#MeToo: Harvey Weinstein to pay sexual abuse victims $17 million

NEW YORK: A US bankruptcy judge has approved a $17 million payout to dozens of women who accused jailed movie producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual abuse. Weinstein, 68, was sentenced to 23 years in prison last year after being convicted of rape and sexual assault. Delaware Judge Mary Walrath on Monday agreed to the Weinstein Company's liquidation plan, which sets aside the payment. She overruled the objections of several of Weinstein's victims who complained that the settlement prevented them from pursuing other legal claims. The money will be split between 37 women, meaning they are each likely to receive six-figure sums. Lawyers representing some victims had earlier denounced the proposed settlement as insufficient. Eight accusers who rejected the settlement will be able to sue the ex-Hollywood mogul later. Weinstein was found guilty in February 2020 of a criminal sexual act in the first degree and rape in the third degree in a landmark verdict for the #MeToo movement. His sentence capped a remarkable downfall for the "Pulp Fiction" producer who was accused of years of vile predatory behavior by almost 90 women, including Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek. The Weinstein Company declared bankruptcy in March 2018 after the avalanche of claims. Lantern Capital, later renamed Spyglass Media Group, bought its assets for $289 million. Weinstein is also awaiting trial in Los Angeles on rape and sexual assault charges involving five women.

WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced the purchase of additional 200 million doses of coronavirus vaccines as the country hit another grim milestone, reaching 25 million infections. After reviewing the current vaccine supply and manufacturing plans, Biden announced that his administration will increase overall weekly vaccination distribution to states and tribal territories from 8.6 million doses to a minimum of 10 million doses. Starting next week, that's an increase of 1.4 million doses per week, he said adding that these are being distributed to states based on population. âWe've got a long way to go, though,â he said in his address to the nation on the steps he is taking to address the coronavirus pandemic. Reiterating his ambitious goal of 100 million shots in 100 days, he said the end goal is to beat Covid-19. Biden said he is directing Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients to work with the Department of Health and Human Services and increase the supply of vaccines for the American people. âWe believe that we will soon be able to confirm the purchase of an additional 100 million doses for each of the two FDA authorised vaccines Pfizer and Moderna,â he said, adding this is 200 million more doses that the federal government had previously secured not in hand yet but ordered. âWe expect these additional 200 million doses to be delivered this summer,â he said. Observing that there are enough vaccine doses to fully vaccinate 300 Americans by the end of the summer, he stressed that over 400,000 people in the country have already died from coronavirus in the past year. âThis is a wartime undertaking. It is not hyperbole, and as such, I directed the team to be ready to exercise all of the authorities I have under the Defense Production Act and expedite these vaccines, and we are using the Defense Production Act to launch full-scale wartime effort to address the supply shortages we inherited from the previous administration,â he said. âThese aggressive steps to increase vaccine supply come on top of the steps we took last week to get more people vaccinated for free, to create more places for them to get vaccinated and to mobilise more medical teams to get shots in people's arms,â Biden said. The president has also directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to stand up the first federally supported community vaccination centers. That work is under way, he said. âWe are working to make vaccines available to thousands of local pharmacies beginning in early February, a couple of weeks off, and that will enormously expand our reach,â he said

From sunny Florida, Trump casts shadow over Republican Party

WASHINGTON: He's gone, he's golfing, but from his palm lined Florida hideaway Donald Trump is also plotting revenge. If many Americans -- perhaps discreetly including a number of senior Republicans -- wished Trump would just disappear at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, they're in for a sore disappointment. As an impeachment trial clanks into gear in Washington, the disgraced ex-president is making clear to Republican senators that they need to remember he is a major force. An announcement on Monday that he was opening "the Office of the Former President" in his new hometown reminded them. "President Trump will always and forever be a champion for the American People," the statement said. Senators are considering Trump's fate in the first impeachment trial ever of a former president and -- after last year's version -- the first time a president has been twice impeached at all. But Trump -- winner of 74 million votes in his defeat to Biden on November 3 and reportedly sitting on some $70 million in campaign funds -- wants Republican senators to consider their own futures before they dare cross him. At least 17 Republicans would need to join the 50 Senate Democrats for a conviction in his trial. Every day that goes by, this appears less likely. On Tuesday, a Republican senator's motion to declare the trial unconstitutional got support from all but five Republicans, the strongest indication yet that a bipartisan conviction is dead on arrival. Yes, a lot of Republican lawmakers are furious at Trump's incitement of a crowd to march on Congress on January 6 in a bid to interrupt certification of President Joe Biden's election win. But Republicans also want to win back the House of Representatives and Senate in the 2022 midterm elections and the White House in 2024. And for now at least, being pro-Trump is arguably the best way to achieve this. According to a January Washington Post-ABC News poll, nearly six in 10 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents believe the party needs to remain under Trump's leadership. Trump's main way of applying pressure while out of office is to threaten disloyal legislators with support for their challengers in party primary votes ahead of the 2022 midterms. Trump's endorsement on Monday of his former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders in her bid to become governor of Arkansas was a first flexing of political muscle. Sanders is competing with more senior party officials in the state for the shot at high office. But in the race to be the most loyal Trump acolyte, she already wins hands down and can expect to reap the rewards. For those who have failed the Trump purity test, nervous days await. During the four years of his presidency, Trump ground down almost any internal opposition. So he was stung by the outpouring of criticism over his actions on January 6 and he'd like revenge. Those on the list include the 10 Republicans in the House who voted with Democrats for his impeachment and now are likely to face primary challenges. If senators go further by voting for his conviction, that would trigger an even harsher response from Trump and grassroot Republicans who believe his lie that he was robbed of election victory. Responding to reports that Trump was considering founding a breakaway right-wing party, advisor Jason Miller told Axios that the ex-president is fully supportive of the Republican Party -- for now. "It's completely up to Republican senators if this is something that becomes more serious," he was quoted as saying. One Republican feeling the tension is Marco Rubio, a senator in Florida.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Cabinet has decided to table a bill in Parliament to amend the Constitution for holding the Senate elections through open vote. The decision was taken during the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, presided over by Prime Minister Imran Khan. âThe government wants the (Senate) polls to be held in a transparent manner and without horse-trading. This is why we want Senate polls to be held through an open ballot,â Information Minister Shibli Faraz told the media after the meeting. He said that in the past, money was used in Senate elections and votes were bought making the House election a mockery. He asked what was the use of an upper house in which people come through purchasing of votes. Faraz also said that people opposing the proposed move are forgetting that their own party had demanded open ballot in the past. âThe government will present a constitutional amendment bill in the parliament so that Senate polls are held through open ballot,â he said. Already the government petitioned to the Supreme Court, seeking direction to hold the upcoming Senate elections through open ballot. The decision is pending. Meanwhile, Dawn newspaper quoted a Cabinet member as saying that Prime Minister Khan tasked his advisor parliamentary affairs Babar Awan to table a bill in the National Assembly for holding Senate elections through open ballot when the adviser was giving a briefing on the status of the government's reference in the Supreme Court. Awan said the government had already laid two bills â Constitution Amendment Bill and Electoral Reforms Bill â in Parliament on the basis of which desired legislation could be done for an open ballot. The Cabinet member said Awan had called a meeting of his ministry and its legislation branch to devise a roadmap on how to proceed with the matter in Parliament. It has been proposed that since Senate polls could not be held through show of hand because every voter has to show his preference in the ballot paper. Therefore, to ensure open identity of the voter, the voter should be required to mention his name on the back side of the ballot paper, according to Dawn newspaper. Senate elections will be held in the first half of next month and prime minister Khan's ruling Pakistan Tehreek-I-Insaf is wary that its own members may vote a gay party policy, according to Opposition parties that are against the move.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Vice-President Maryam Nawaz on Tuesday claimed that Imran Khan-led government is "begging" before the opposition for a dialogue, but the opposition had decided not to hold any talks with it, reported Dawn. "You will be surprised if I tell you the details as to how they [the government people] are begging before the opposition for talks," Maryam said in response to a question about a meeting of the opposition leaders with a government team before the start of the National Assembly session on Friday. She said the opposition would submit its resignations from the assemblies at an appropriate time and with a consensus within the 10-party Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), reported Dawn. "Resignations will be submitted and a long march will take place," she said, adding that the present "incompetent government" would not be able to stay in power anymore. She declared 2021 an election year. Maryam made the above statement while attending a joint meeting of the party's parliamentary groups in the National Assembly and Senate. Moreover, Maryam said the PML-N would not allow the government to change the accountability laws, adding that the present rulers would face the same NAB (National Accountability Bureau) which was now for the opposition. Meanwhile, the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) parliamentarians have ruled out the possibility of holding talks with the government on any issue and reposed full confidence in the leadership and narrative of their party's supreme leader Nawaz Sharif. They also declared the Pakistan Peoples Party's (PPP) proposal to move a no-trust motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan "impracticable", reported Dawn. Later, Maryam through her social media account on Twitter, termed the support of the party members to Nawaz Sharif "phenomenal" and said the PML-N had truly become an ideological party. "The party stands committed and united under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif more than ever before. The support and resolve were phenomenal. This is new, ideological PML-N Alhamdulillah," wrote Maryam Nawaz with her pictures at the PML-N meeting. During the meeting, PML-N besides discussing the political situation also talked about some organisational matters. After the two-hour-long meeting, the party released to the media a copy of the hard-hitting resolution passed by the PML-N parliamentarians. Through the resolution, the PML-N pointed out that "the appointments of retired and in-service military officers in the institutions within Pakistan are practically painting a picture of martial law in the country due to which the civil bureaucracy in the institutions and the people at large are suffering from severe uneasiness and anxiety", reported Dawn. The resolution announced full support for PML-N Quaid Nawaz Sharif's narrative and the principled position taken by him. "Nawaz Sharif has not only pointed out the correct reasons for the serious dangers facing the nation but also proves that he is a true patriot by presenting these hard and inconvenient truths to the people," added the release. The PML-N members said in the resolution that Sharif's narrative of "restoration of sanctity of vote had become the voice of the entire nation". "In the light of its leader's vision, narrative and insight, the party consider the proposed course of action to address these issues to be the right path," they added. The meeting slammed the unjustified arrest and detention of party president Shehbaz Sharif, Hamza Shehbaz and Khawaja Asif and Syed Khurshid Shah and the reprehensible treatment of the prisoners, reported Dawn. The PML-N said Pakistan was fast becoming a "failed state" at home and abroad. On the one hand, national assets were being confiscated and, on the one hand, Pakistan's image was being defiled in the international arena, it added, adding that the responsibility for this "national embarrassment" lies on the "incompetent, thieving and foreign-imposed government". The meeting expressed grave concern over the economic condition of the country. It called for an investigation into the nationwide power outage. PML-N also charged the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) with obstructing the disclosure of facts of the foreign funding case for six years, which is regrettable, worrying and reprehensible. The party demanded that all documents related to the case, including 23 secret bank accounts, be made public and all its proceedings are done in full public view. The meeting also condemned the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Authority Bill and its immunity and said that a person (retired Lt Gen Asim Saleem Bajwa) facing controversy and allegations of corruption should not be the head of a sensitive project like CPEC as it was against the national interest. Earlier, Bajwa was exposed by local media of several offshore businesses, including more than 100 companies and franchises in the US, the UAE and Canada in which his families were involved. In 2019, Prime Minister Imran Khan had promulgated an ordinance to establish a CPEC Authority ahead of his visit to China and had appointed Bajwa as its chairperson. While earlier, the Planning and Development Ministry used to oversee the CPEC projects.

ISLAMABAD: The body of Karima Baloch, a 37-year-old Pakistani dissident from the ethnic Baloch community and a prominent women's rights activist, who died in mysterious circumstances while in exile in Canada, was brought home and buried in her village in the restive Balochistan province amid tight security, officials said on Monday. Karima, who was highly critical of Pakistan's security agencies and campaigned extensively against disappearances and human rights violations in the troubled Balochistan province, was found dead in Toronto downtown waterfront on December 22. Officials said that her immediate family was present at the funeral on Sunday in the Tump village of the Keach area of the restive province. Security was tight due to the fear of protests by the Baloch nationalists who cherished her as their leader. Her supporters claimed on social media that the village was virtually sealed off so that people from other areas could not attend the funeral. In some videos, people are seen requesting security forces to allow them to attend the funeral prayers. Security sources said that the mobile phone services were suspended in the area to avoid any untoward incidents as militants often use it to carry out acts of sabotage. Toronto police have not treated her death as suspicious though there were allegations by her supporters that she was killed. Her family members are not sure what happened. According to police in Toronto, her body was found near Lake Ontario, but no further details were given. Police said they did no believe there were any suspicious circumstances. "The Toronto Police Service is aware of heightened community and media interest surrounding a missing person investigation," the force said in a statement. "The circumstances have been investigated and officers have determined this to be a non-criminal death and no foul play is suspected." "The death of activist Karima Baloch in Toronto, Canada is deeply shocking and must be immediately and effectively investigated. The perpetrators must be brought to justice without recourse to the death penalty,â Amnesty International South Asia said in a tweet last month. Karima was highly critical of Pakistan's security institutions like her fellow nationalists who alleged that the federal government was exploiting the mineral resources while keeping the region impoverished. The charge is always rejected by the institutions. She was living in Canada where she was granted asylum in 2016. Karima, a critic of the Pakistani government and powerful military, had campaigned extensively against disappearances and human rights violations in Balochistan. In 2016, she was named on BBC's list of 100 inspirational women. At 30, she was the first woman to become the leader of the Balochistan Student Organisation. She left Pakistan in 2015, after terrorism charges were levelled against her. Her family said she had been given death threats. Her sister told the BBC Urdu service last month that Karima's death was "not only a tragedy for the family, but also for the Baloch national movement". "She didn't go abroad because she wanted to, but because... open activism in Pakistan had become impossible," Mahganj Baloch was quoted as saying by the BBC Urdu service.

ISLAMABAD: The Afghan government on Saturday welcomed the move by the Biden administration to review the February 2020 deal that Washington had signed with Taliban insurgents. Sediq Sediqqi, spokesperson of Afghan President Dr Ashraf Ghani, said in a statement that the US-Taliban agreement has so far failed to deliver the desired goal of ending Taliban violence and bringing a ceasefire. âThe Taliban did not live up to its commitments,â he said. His statement followed a phone conversation between Jake Sullivan, the new US national security adviser, and his Afghan counterpart Hamdullah Mohib. The Biden administration on Friday said that it was looking to review the deal between Washington and the Taliban. In the conversation with Sullivan, Mohib said that they agreed to work towards a permanent ceasefire and a just and durable peace in Afghanistan âcapable of preserving the gains of the past two decades, protecting the rights of all Afghans, and continuing the reforms.â In a series of tweets on Saturday, Mohib said that Sullivan affirmed that the partnership with the government of Afghanistan and Afghan security and defense forces remains a priority and a key to US national security objectives. âWe will continue close consultations in the days and weeks ahead,â he added. Last week, following the targeted assassination of two female judges in the capital Kabul, the US Embassy warned the Taliban to cease attacks on civilians for peace to come to Afghanistan. âThe Taliban should understand that such actions for which it bears responsibility outrage the world and must cease if peace is to come to Afghanistan,â tweeted Ross Wilson, the US chargÃ© dâaffaires. The review comes amid the stalled intra-Afghan talks in the Qatari capital of Doha, which aimed at ending the nearly two-decade conflict in war-torn Afghanistan. Former US President Donald Trump had made the withdrawal of US Nato troops from Afghanistan a priority. According to the US-Taliban deal, the US and Nato allies would withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by May this year if the Taliban upheld its promises. The promises included not to allow militant outfits to operate from areas controlled by the Taliban, shunning violence and to start dialogue with the government in Kabul. Following the deal, the militants halted attacks to a greater extent on foreign troops but intensified its fight against Kabul, with the country having seen a wave of targeted killings in recent months. Journalists, activists, politicians and women judges were among those killed in targeted assassinations. Given the volatile situation in the war-torn country, the new US administration has said that it will review a peace deal that President Trump had made with the Taliban.

KATHMANDU: Nepal's Election Commission has refused to recognise any of the two factions of the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) as the official party, saying both failed to adopt due procedures to gain the legitimate status. The election commission in its decision on Sunday stated that since both the groups â one led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal "Prachanda" and other by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli â failed to adopt due procedures, they would not gain any recognition. With the latest decision of the election commission, Oli and Prachanda remain the chairpersons despite a vertical split in the party. The Prachanda-led faction had earlier removed Oli from the post of chairman and picked Madhav Kumar Nepal in his place. The faction on Sunday decided to strip Oli of even the party's general membership. The Prachanda-led faction claimed that they should be recognised as the official NCP as they command the majority in the party's Secretariat, Standing Committee, and Central Committee. EC officials said it is difficult to bring any amendments, changes, or reshuffle in the record as demanded by both the factions of the NCP as per the party's statute. The ruling NCP saw a vertical split across the party's committees after Prime Minister Oli decided to dissolve the House of Representatives and announced midterm elections for April 30 and May 10. Both Oli and Prachanda factions have been holding mass gatherings and other party activities to show their strength.

NCP's Prachanda-led faction expels PM Oli from party's general membership

KATHMANDU: The ruling Nepal Communist Party's splinter faction led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal âPrachanda' on Sunday expelled Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli from the party's general membership. The decision to remove Oli from the party's general membership was taken at the Standing Committee meeting of the faction led by former prime ministers Prachanda and Madhav Kumar Nepal after Oli failed to produce explanation to his recent moves as sought by party leadership, sources said. Earlier in December, the splinter group had removed Oli, one of the two chairmen of the ruling party, as the party chair. Madhav Nepal was named as the party's second chairman. Prachanda is the first chairman of the party. The Prachanda-led faction on January 15 sought clarification from Oli alleging that he was carrying out activities that go against the party's policies. The faction decided to strip Oli off even from the ordinary membership of the party after he chose not to furnish any clarification, party sources said. Oli had been accused of violating party statute by the splinter group. The latest political development came two days after the NCP's splinter faction led a massive anti-government rally, saying the "unconstitutional" dissolution of the Parliament by Prime Minister Oli has posed serious threats to the country's hard-earned federal democratic republic system. Prachanda last week said that by dissolving the House, Oli has given a blow to the Constitution as well as the democratic republic system which has been established in the country through seven decades of struggle by the people. Madhav Nepal, who last month replaced Oli as the chairman of the party by Prachanda-led faction, said that the Constitution has not given rights to the prime minister to dissolve Parliament. Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 after Oli, known for his pro-China leanings, in a surprise move dissolved Parliament, amidst a tussle for power with Prachanda. His move to dissolve the 275-member House, sparked protests from a large section of the NCP led by Prachanda, also a co-chair of the ruling party. Oli, who is the chairperson of a faction of the NCP, has said he was forced to dissolve the House after knowing that the Prachanda-led faction was planning to file a no-confidence motion against him and introduce an impeachment motion against President Bidya Devi Bhandari. Oli-led CPN-UML and Prachanda-led NCP (Maoist Centre) merged in May 2018 to form a unified Nepal Communist Party following victory of their alliance in the 2017 general elections. After a vertical split in the ruling party following the dissolution of the House, both the factions, one led by Oli and another led by Prachanda, have submitted separate applications at the Election Commission claiming that their faction is the genuine party and asked to provide them the election symbol of the party. However, the Election Commission is yet to decide the matter. In December, China sent a four-member high-level delegation to Nepal to prevent a split within the NCP. The team - led by a Vice minister of the Chinese Communist Party, Guo Yezhou - held separate meetings with several top NCP leaders before returning home without much success in its mission. India has described Oli's sudden decision to dissolve Parliament and call for fresh elections as an "internal matter" that is for the country to decide as per its democratic processes.

DHAKA: Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has thanked her Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for sending over two million doses of Covid-19 vaccine as a gift to Bangladesh. India on Thursday officially handed over 2 million doses of domestically produced Covishield vaccine to Bangladesh. The vaccines were provided at a crucial time when the number of coronavirus cases in Bangladesh is rising. "I thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi for sending the vaccine (batch) as a gift," Hasina said at an online international conference held on the occasion of the 100th founding anniversary of the University of Dhaka on Thursday.  She said the government has already planned how it would proceed with the vaccine, the Dhaka Tribune reported.  "We have taken all the steps to face the Covid-19 situation in the country," Hasina said.  Apart from the current delivery of vaccines, Bangladesh is also set to purchase 3 crore doses of India-made coronavirus vaccine. Hasina hoped that the vaccine that Bangladesh procured from India would arrive by January 25-26, the report said. Bangladesh has so far recorded 7,966 Covid-19 deaths since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year, while the total number of infections have surged to over 530,270.  India also handed over 1 million doses of coronavirus vaccines to Nepal on Thursday. On Wednesday, India sent 150,000 doses of Covishield vaccines to Bhutan and 100,000 doses to the Maldives.

LONDON: Imams across Britain are helping a drive to dispel coronavirus disinformation, using Friday sermons and their influential standing within Muslim communities to argue that Covid-19 vaccines are safe. Qari Asim, chairman of the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board (MINAB) which is leading a campaign to reassure its faithful, is among those publically advocating that the inoculations are compatible with Islamic practices. "We are confident that the two vaccines that have been used in the UK, Oxford AstraZeneca and Pfizer, are permissible from an Islamic perspective," he told AFP. "The hesitancy, the anxiety (and) concern is driven by misinformation, conspiracy theories, fake news and rumours." Britain, the hardest-hit country in Europe by the virus after registering nearly 95,000 deaths, is relying on its biggest-ever vaccination effort to end repeated cycles of lockdowns and restrictions. However, a report from the scientific committee advising the government showed stronger mistrust of vaccines among ethnic minorities than the rest of the UK population. It highlighted that 72 percent of Black survey respondents were unlikely or very unlikely to get the vaccine. Among those from Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds, the figure was 42 percent. Imams are pushing back in particular at fears among Britain's estimated 2.8 million Muslims that the vaccines contain pork gelatin or alcohol, which are banned by Islam. Asim said it was "legitimate" to question whether things were permissible under Islam but without paying attention to unfounded claims. Among the falsehoods spread about the vaccine are that it can modify DNA, make recipients sterile, or even involve inserting a microchip in the body. Misinformation around the coronavirus is all the more dangerous given several studies have shown that it can impact minorities disproportionately. "These are precisely the communities we should be trying to target," said Nighat Arif, a general practitioner based in Chesham, near London. When she received her vaccination, she posted a video in Urdu on social media aimed at the language's speakers living in Britain. "I'm hoping that because they see someone who looks like them, who is a practising Muslim, wears a hijab, someone who is Asian who speaks their language, that's more relatable than something that's coming through from the government," she added. Arif is still surprised by the refusal of certain patients to be inoculated, noting they will often get vaccinated to undertake the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabi, or to visit Pakistan or India. She blames conspiracy theories spread online, which contribute to the science behind the process "being lost". Samara Afzal, 34, a general practitioner at Netherton Health Centre in Dudley in the West Midlands, also shared a video in Urdu with her 35,000 Twitter followers to "debunk some myths". She said some people had asked her to send the video directly to them so they could forward it to sceptical loved ones via social tools like WhatsApp. At her medical centre, Afzal estimates that around 40 to 50 people out of 1,000 have refused to be vaccinated when she had expected only one or two. "It's still a fair amount of people that are saying no and obviously we haven't even addressed the younger ones, so this is just the elderly," she added. "So I'm sure when it comes down to the younger ones, there'll be a lot more that say no." Around five million people, almost entirely the elderly and caregivers, have already received a first dose of the vaccine in the UK, the highest rate in Europe. In a sign of officials' concerns about minority take-up of the jabs, the state-run health service is mobilising "influencers" in communities to convince the sceptics. "There's a big piece of work happening where we're translating information, we're making sure the look and feel of it reaches the populations that matter," Harpreet Sood, a doctor who is leading the anti-disinformation campaign, told the BBC. A vaccination centre has even been set up in a mosque in Birmingham, Britain's second biggest city, which has a large south Asian population. Imam Nuru Mohammed said the move sent "a big 'no to fake news'" message to his 2,000-strong religious community and beyond. He shared the video of his own vaccination on social media. For Asim, the MINAB chairman whose mosque is in Leeds, in northern England, their efforts also help counter far-right claims. "If there was a lower take-up of vaccines in Muslim communities in comparison to all other communities, then potentially, it could fan the flames of Islamophobia," he noted. "And in this pandemic, no one should be scapegoated."

LONDON: As the United Kingdom on Tuesday crossed the grim milestone of 100,000 deaths due to Covid-19, Prime Minister Boris Johnson extended condolences to the kin of victims and said it was hard to "compute the sorrow contained in the grim statistic". Johnson during a Covid-19 briefing on Tuesday said that he and his government take "full responsibility" for the decisions taken by him and his Cabinet to curb the spread of the virus and reduce the fatalities due to the pathogen. The British Prime Minister further said that he "was sorry for every life that has been lost" stating that the government did everything they could possibly do. "I am sorry to have to tell you that today the number of deaths recorded from Covid in the UK has surpassed 100,000, and it is hard to compute the sorrow contained in that grim statistic. The years of life lost, the family gatherings not attended and, for so many relatives, the missed chance even to say goodbye," Johnson said during a briefing on Tuesday. He added, "I offer my deepest condolences to everyone who has lost a loved one; fathers and mothers; brothers and sisters; sons and daughters and the many grandparents who have been taken... I am deeply sorry for every life that has been lost and of course, as Prime Minister, I take full responsibility for everything the government has done. What I can tell you is that we truly did everything we could and continue to do everything we can do." The British Prime Minister pledged that when the country "comes through" this crisis, the British public would come together and remember "everyone we lost". "To all those who grieve, we make this pledge: that when we have come through this crisis, we will come together as a nation to remember everyone we lost, and to honour the selfless heroism of all those on the front line who gave their lives to save others," he said. "We will remember the courage of countless working people -- not just our amazing NHS and care workers, but shop workers, transport staff, pharmacists, teachers, police, armed forces emergency services and many others - who kept our country going during our biggest crisis since the Second World War," he added. According to Sputnik, the UK vaccination campaign started on December 8 and as of Tuesday, around 6.5 million people have received at least one vaccine dose. The vaccination is currently open to five priority groups, including people over 80 years old, some people over 70, clinically vulnerable persons, personnel of care homes, and medical workers. There are currently three authorised vaccines in the United Kingdom -- the domestically-made AstraZeneca, the US-German Pfizer/BioNTech, and the one developed by US company Moderna. Johnson called for lessons to be learnt and reflect on once "those vaccines have finally freed us" and added that the best "and most important thing" the people can all do to honour the memory of those who have died from Covid-19 is to "work together with ever greater resolve to defeat this disease." As per the latest update by Johns Hopkins University, the United Kingdom has over 3.7 million Covid-19 cases and 100,359 deaths from the deadly virus across the country.

LONDON: The UK on Tuesday hit another grim Covid-19 milestone as the country's death toll from the deadly virus crossed 100,000 since the peak of the pandemic last year, with another 1,631 daily deaths. The total number of fatalities in the country has reached 100,162. "It's hard to compute the sorrow contained in that grim statistic, the years of life lost, the family gatherings not attended and for many relatives not even the chance to say goodbye," said UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, as he unveiled the latest figures at a briefing from 10 Downing Street in London. âIt's an appalling and tragic loss of life. All we can do now is work together with the tolls that we have with the stay at home principle, plus the vaccines, to defeat the virus," he said. Johnson promised that the country will commemorate the lives lost together at a future date and also the "immense national effort" to tackle the pandemic â from health workers to scientists developing vaccines and key workers. England's Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, joined Johnson at the briefing on the "very sad dayâ and went through health data to note that the number of people testing positive for Covid-19 in the UK peaked at an extremely high number but it is coming down. "We need to be realistic that that number will come down relatively slowly over the next two weeksâ¦ We need to be careful we do not relax (lockdown restrictions) too early,â he said. The government's latest data now coincides with earlier Office for National Statistics (ONS) assessment of death certificate data, which had revealed that there have been nearly 104,000 deaths since last year. The UK government's daily death toll figures rely on positive coronavirus tests in the past 28 days and are therefore slightly behind on the death certificate figures. The ONS figures showed that a total of 7,245 registered deaths in England and Wales mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate in the week ending January 15, which is up from 6,057 deaths the week before and is the highest weekly number since April 24, 2020. "It is a tragedy that we have now seen more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19. This is a dreadful milestone to have reached, and behind each death will be a story of sorrow and grief,â said Chris Hopson, Chief Executive of NHS Providers, a membership organisation for the state-funded National Health Service (NHS). "We won't know the true impact of Covid-19 for a long time to come because of its long-term effects â but, as well as the high death rate, it's particularly concerning that this virus has widened health inequalities and affected Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities disproportionately,â he said, urging continued âvigilanceâ among all communities and strictly following the rules of social distancing. âThe vaccine offers hope for the future. This is a key phase in the fight to end Covid-19 but we must stay the course until the end is truly in sight,â he added. The latest figures come as the UK government is considering further measures in its fight against a high rate of infections, including the possibility of imposing compulsory 10-day hospital quarantine for travellers entering Britain from regions believed to be at a high risk of spreading new variants of coronavirus. âThe NHS is still under intense pressure across all parts of the country with 37,899 people in UK hospitals with Covid-19 â and that includes 4,076 on ventilators,â said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock, as he reiterated the message for people to continue following lockdown restrictions. The minister highlighted that his department-led vaccination programme remains on track to meet the government-set target of covering all those under the top priority groups by mid-February, despite vaccine supply pressures. âThe rate limiting factor to this vaccination programme remains supply. As we know, supply is tight. We've had a very strong performance in this past week. And I'm confident that the NHS will deliver every shot that's made available to it,â he said, adding that 78.7 per cent of all over 80s have now been vaccinated as of Monday. The government has also rolled out a new Community Champions scheme through local councils, with popular celebrities including British Indian actors Meera Syal and Sanjeev Bhaskar also launching independent efforts, to help combat reluctance among minority communities towards being vaccinated. âIt is vital that everyone has access to accurate and up to date information about Covid-19. False information about Covid-19 vaccines could cost lives,â said Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick. Over 23 million pounds funding has been allocated to 60 councils and voluntary groups across England to expand work to support those most at risk from Covid-19 and boost vaccine take up. âWe want all communities to take up the offer of a free vaccine and I have been working closely with faith and community leaders to ensure those who may be at higher risk of harm from this virus know how they can benefit from a vaccine,â said Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi. âThe expansion of the Community Champions scheme will help everyone get the advice and information they need about Covid-19 vaccines,â he said.

LONDON: Britain pushed ahead with plans for its first fighter drone on Monday, signing a 30 million pound ($41 million) design and manufacture contract for the unmanned aircraft to have a trial flight in the next three years. The government said in a statement that the drones will be built to act as a "loyal wingman" to its Typhoons and F-35s, flying alongside the military jets to shoot down enemy aircraft. Last November, the country announced its biggest military spending increase since the Cold War, pledging to end the "era of retreat". The extra 1.5 billion pounds of investment for military research and development will help fund the new drones. The new contract was signed with the Belfast unit of Spirit AeroSystems, the U.S. group which last year acquired the former Bombardier business in Northern Ireland, and includes a full-scale vehicle flight test programme by the end of 2023. If the programme, named Team MOSQUITO and which also includes the UK unit of Northrop Grumman, is successful, the government said that the drones could be deployed alongside British fighter jets by the end of the decade. The three-year contract will support more than 100 jobs in Belfast, the government statement said.

MOSCOW: Russia's capital Moscow on Wednesday announced a further easing of Covid restrictions citing the improving health situation, even as many countries tighten anti-virus measures. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced the changes as European nations looked to tighten their borders, with Britain struggling to counter a brutal third wave and the Netherlands facing riots over a coronavirus curfew. "The pandemic is on the wane, and in these conditions it's our duty to create conditions for the economy to recover as soon as possible," Sobyanin wrote on his blog. From Wednesday, bars, restaurants and nightclubs -- which previously were required to close by 11:00 pm -- will be able to remain open through the night, though they will still have to enforce social distancing and sanitary guidelines. Employers will no longer be obliged to ensure that at least 30 percent of their staff are working from home, with the implementation of work-from-home rules now at the discretion of companies and organisations. Sobyanin's announcement made no mention of public gatherings, with a ban on mass rallies apparently remaining in place. Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny's allies have called for new rallies this weekend, after tens of thousands demonstrated in support of him across the country on Saturday. As the second wave of the pandemic swept across Europe in the autumn, Russia opted against re-introducing strict lockdown measures like at the start of the pandemic in the spring and instead pinned its hopes on the quick distribution of a vaccine to end its outbreak. Sobyanin said Wednesday that over the past week the city of more than 12 million people was registering an average of 2,000-3,000 new infections a day -- a steep decline from the some 7,000 infections it saw at the peak of its second wave. The Moscow mayor added that 50 percent of beds in coronavirus hospitals were now free for the first time since mid-June. However, he advised the elderly and people suffering from chronic illnesses to stay at home. Sobyanin said the lifting of remaining restrictions will be announced separately. Russia launched a mass inoculation campaign this month, making its first homegrown vaccine, Sputnik V, available to all citizens 18 and older. As of Tuesday, Russia had registered more than 3.7 million coronavirus cases -- including some 900,000 cases in Moscow -- and more than 70,000 fatalities.

MOSCOW: Kremlin foe Alexei Navalny was jailed nearly two weeks ago when he returned to Russia from Germany after recovering from exposure to a nerve toxin. The day after he was put behind bars, his team released an investigative report accompanied by a two-hour YouTube video accusing Russian leader Vladimir Putin of being gifted a luxurious property on the Black Sea coast. Putin has strongly denied that he is its owner. Here's what you need to know: The 44-year-old anti-graft campaigner's report is not the first to suggest that Putin is the main resident of a coastal palace near the town of Gelendzhik in southern Russia. In 2010, businessman Sergei Kolesnikov blew the whistle on the luxury complex. He said he was asked by close associates of Putin to transfer via his company donations made by oligarchs into a fund that was intended for renovating hospitals but was instead used to finance the construction of the property. The businessman fled Russia before publishing a heap of documents on the palace accompanied by an open letter to then-president Dmitry Medvedev, urging him to investigate the case. The authorities rejected Kolesnikov's claims and his initiative failed to gain traction. Navalny's investigation describes the lavish property in detail using drone footage and 3D visualisations of the interior based on leaked architectural blueprints. The report alleges that the 17,700 square metre complex includes a church, vineyards, an underground hockey arena and a private casino. It says that boats are prohibited from approaching the property along the coast and there is a no-fly zone above it. Navalny, who accuses Putin of being "obsessed with wealth and luxury", estimates that the construction of the property cost more than $1.5 billion. Underscoring the grand price tag, the Kremlin critic noted in particular that it features Italian-made toilet brushes estimated at 700 euros ($851) apiece. The construction of the complex, according to Navalny's investigation, was financed by companies linked to Putin's inner circle. Navalny refers to the financing scheme as the "biggest bribe in the world". The Kremlin critic points to Igor Sechin, head of the oil giant Rosneft, and businessman Yuri Kovalchuk, who is under Western sanctions and is allegedly Putin's banker, as being involved. The funds for the property were allegedly obtained through questionable rental contracts involving state-owned companies, including the pipeline firm Transneft run by Nikolai Tokarev. Tokarev, according to the investigation, was a KGB officer stationed alongside Putin in East Germany. Following the release of Navalny's report that has garnered nearly 93 million views on YouTube and fuelled anti-Kremlin rallies over the weekend, Putin personally denied the allegations. "Nothing that is listed there as my property belongs to me or my close relatives, and never did," the Russian president said during a video call with students. He denounced the accusations as "brainwashing" of Russians using an edited photo montage and said there were no documents in the investigation providing proof of ownership. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday said the Kremlin knows who the owners of the palace are but does not have the right to reveal their names.

BRUSSELS: The European Union on Tuesday warned pharmaceutical giants that have developed coronavirus vaccines with EU aid that it must get its shots on schedule, a day after the bloc threatened to impose export controls on vaccines produced within its borders. The EU made it very clear that it is bent on getting all doses as quickly as their contracts provide for at a time when infections are surging, many hospitals are overwhelmed, and many of the 27 members states are struggling to get their vaccine rollout going at top speed. The hardening of its position came days after it accused AstraZeneca of failing to guarantee the delivery of coronavirus vaccines without a valid explanation. It also had expressed displeasure over vaccine delivery delays from Pfizer-BioNTech. The Pfizer vaccine is already being rolled out in the EU, and the AstraZeneca one is expected to be approved this week. âEurope invested billions to help develop the worldâs first Covid-19 vaccines,â EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the World Economic Forumâs virtual event in Switzerland. âAnd now, the companies must deliver. They must honor their obligations.â The EU, which invested â¬2.7 billion in vaccine research and production for the drug companies, âmeans businessâ, she added, reflecting the heavy pressure EU nations are under to roll out vaccines. In a sign of concern that pharma groups might be selling the earmarked doses to higher bidders outside the bloc, Von der Leyen said, âWe will set up a vaccine export transparency mechanism to ensure the firms meet their contractual obligations.â Though the bloc says itâs not exactly an export ban, critics say it could lead to it while the EU gets its allotment. Both Astra-Zeneca and Pfizer have vaccines made in the EU. The EU has committed to buying 300 million AstraZeneca doses with option on 100 million extra shots. Late last week, the firm said it was planning to reduce a first contingent of 80 million to 31 million. Pfizer said it was delaying deliveries to Europe and Canada while it upgrades its plant in Belgium to increase output.

Rome: Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte resigned Tuesday in the hope of forming a new government after weeks of turmoil in his ruling coalition, leaving Italy rudderless as it battles the deadly coronavirus pandemic.  He tendered his resignation to President Sergio Mattarella, the ultimate arbiter of Italian political crises, who invited him to stay on in a caretaker capacity pending discussions on what happens next.  The uneasy coalition that has led Italy since September 2019 was fatally weakened earlier this month by the withdrawal of former premier Matteo Renzi's small but crucial Italia Viva party.  Ahead of a key vote in parliament this week that he looked set to lose, Conte informed his cabinet on Tuesday that he would quit in what supporters said was a move to form a new government.  After the meeting with Mattarella, a spokesman for the president said he "reserves the right to decide (what to do next) and invited the government to stay in office in a caretaker capacity".  Mattarella will open discussions with party leaders on Wednesday afternoon which are likely to lead into Thursday -- leaving a vacuum at the top of the eurozone's third largest economy at a crucial time.  Italy was the first European country to face the full force of the Covid-19 pandemic and has since suffered badly, with the economy plunged into recession and deaths still rising by around 400 a day.  Parts of the country remain under partial lockdown, the vaccination programme has slowed and a deadline is looming to agree plans to spend billions of euros in European Union recovery funds.  Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, one of the leaders of the populist Five Star Movement (M5S), the largest in parliament, earlier said it was time to rally around Conte.  "The country is going through one of its worst ever periods due to the pandemic," he tweeted late Monday. "Now we need unity, we all have to gather around Giuseppe Conte."  - New mandate - Conte's government had been on the verge of collapse since Renzi pulled out on January 13 in a row over the premier's handling of the pandemic.  Renzi in particular warned he risked wasting the EU funds with a 220-billion-euro ($267 billion) spending plan that he said failed to address Italy's long-term structural issues.  The prime minister survived a vote of confidence in parliament last week but failed to secure an overall majority in the upper house, the Senate.  Despite days of talks with senators to seek their support, he looked set to lose a crucial vote on judicial reform in the coming days.  "Conte's calculation is that by moving early, and thereby avoiding a humiliating defeat in the Senate later this week, he would increase his chances of securing a mandate from Mattarella to form a new government," noted Wolfango Piccoli of the Teneo consultancy.  Nicola Zingaretti, leader of the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), the other main partner in the coalition, so far is backing Conte.  He tweeted that he was "with Conte for a new government that is clearly pro-European and supported by a broad parliamentary base".  - Ditch Conte? - But other lawmakers will be needed to form a viable new government -- and "it is currently unclear whether Conte can succeed in such an effort", Piccoli noted.  If he cannot, the M5S and PD could "ditch Conte and look for another candidate" to head a new coalition government.  They are keen to avoid snap elections, which opinion polls suggest would lead to victory for the centre-right coalition comprising billionaire former premier Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia and Matteo Salvini's far-right League party.  Conte, a once obscure law professor, has proved himself remarkably adept at navigating the famously choppy waters of Italian politics.  Since the 2018 elections he has been at the helm of two governments of different political shades.  The first was a fractious and unashamedly populist coalition between M5S and Salvini's League, which ended when the latter pulled out in August 2019.  Conte went on to preside over another unlikely coalition -- the so-called Conte II government -- between M5S and the PD, two former sworn enemies.

NEW DELHI: China said on Wednesday that the Indian government's decision to keep a ban on 59 Chinese apps was a violation of the World Trade Organization's fair rules of business and would hurt Chinese firms. The ban dates from last year when political tension between the neighbours rose over their disputed border. This month the Indian government decided to keep the ban on TikTok and other apps. "We urge the Indian side to immediately correct its discriminatory measures and avoid causing further damage to bilateral cooperation," Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong said in a statement.

BEIJING: Chinaâs coronavirus vaccines were supposed to deliver a geopolitical win that showcased the countryâs scientific prowess and generosity. Instead, in some places, they have set off a backlash. Officials in Brazil and Turkey have complained that Chinese companies have been slow to ship the doses and ingredients. Disclosures about the Chinese vaccines have been slow and spotty. The few announcements that have trickled out suggest that Chinaâs vaccines, while considered effective, cannot stop the virus as well as those developed by Pfizer and Moderna, the American drugmakers. In the Philippines, some lawmakers have criticized the governmentâs decision to buy a vaccine made by a Chinese company, Sinovac. Officials in Malaysia and Singapore, which both ordered doses from Sinovac, have had to reassure their citizens that they would approve a vaccine only if it had been proved safe and effective. âRight now, I would not take any Chinese vaccine because thereâs insufficient data,â said Bilahari Kausikan, an influential former official at Singaporeâs Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He added that he would consider it only with âa proper report.â At least 24 countries, most of them low and middle income, signed deals with the Chinese vaccine companies because they offered access when richer nations had claimed most of the doses made by Pfizer and Moderna. But the delays in getting the Chinese vaccines and the fact that the vaccines are less effective mean that those countries may take longer to vanquish the virus. Beijing officials who had hoped the vaccines would burnish Chinaâs global reputation are now on the defensive. State media has started a misinformation campaign against the American vaccines, questioning the safety of the Pfizer and Moderna shots and promoting the Chinese vaccines as a better alternative. It has also distributed online videos that have been shared by the anti-vaccine movement in the United States. Liu Xin, an anchor with CGTN, the state broadcaster, asked on Twitter why the foreign media has failed to âfollow upâ on the deaths of people in Germany who had taken one vaccine â though scientists have said the people were already seriously ill. Liuâs tweet was shared by Zhao Lijian, a top spokesman at Chinaâs Foreign Ministry. George Gao, head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, has questioned the safety of the American vaccines because their developers used new techniques rather than the traditional method embraced by Chinese makers. China had hoped its vaccines would prove it had become a scientific and diplomatic powerhouse. It remains on par with the United States in the number of vaccines approved for emergency use or in late-stage trials. Sinopharm, a state-owned vaccine-maker, and Sinovac have said they can produce up to a combined 2 billion doses this year, making them essential to the global fight against the coronavirus. Unlike the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, their doses can be kept at refrigerated temperatures and are more easily transported, making them appealing to the developing world. They have been doled out as aid to countries like Pakistan and the Philippines. Chinaâs campaign has been plagued with doubts, however. Many people have memories of the countryâs vaccine scandals. Several governments remain angry about Beijingâs lack of openness about the virus in the early days of the pandemic. Its efforts at the start of last year to distribute masks and protective equipment to the West came under fire amid reports of shoddy quality and the demands by Chinese officials for public thanks. A YouGov survey this month of roughly 19,000 people in 17 countries and regions showed that most were distrustful of a Covid-19 vaccine made in China. The misinformation campaign surrounding Western vaccines could further undermine its image. The delays in shipments to places like Brazil and Turkey have been the latest hitch. In Turkey, the government initially promised that 10 million doses of the Sinovac vaccine would arrive in December. Only 3 million did in early January, according to Fahrettin Koca, Turkeyâs health minister. He did not explain the reason for the shortfall, which has been criticized by opposition politicians. The remaining doses finally arrived Monday, according to Anadolu, Turkeyâs state-run news agency. In a statement, Chinaâs Foreign Ministry cited its needs at home, where the coronavirus has reemerged. âCurrently, Chinaâs domestic vaccine demand is huge,â it said. âWhile meeting domestic demand, we are overcoming difficulties, thinking and trying ways to develop international vaccine cooperation with other countries, especially developing countries in different ways, and providing support and assistance according to their needs and within our capacity.â The sporadic outbreaks could also hinder production. Sinovac, which declined to comment, said Friday online that it was looking for workers for a Beijing-area facility where an outbreak had frightened off potential employees. Countries like Turkey and Brazil are rolling out their immunization programs with a Sinovac vaccine because Western companies cannot deliver as quickly. But Brazilâs efforts have been delayed as well. Eduardo Pazuello, the countryâs health minister, said China was not acting fast enough with the documents needed to export raw materials to Brazil. âWe are making strong moves at the diplomatic level to find where that resistance is and solve the problem,â Pazuello said at a news conference Jan. 17. On Wednesday, Rodrigo Maia, Brazilâs speaker of the house, told reporters that he had met the Chinese ambassador to Brazil, who âmade it clear that there is no political obstacle, that it was a technical process that was delayed a little.â Other vaccines are beginning to fill the gap. Brazilâs Health Ministry announced Thursday that a previously delayed shipment of 2 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine would arrive the next day from India. The world was also caught off guard by the disclosure that the Sinovac vaccine may not be as effective as previously thought. Earlier, officials in Turkey said trials there showed the vaccine had a 91% efficacy rate. In Indonesia, it was 68%. In Brazil, researchers initially said its efficacy was 78%. Then, January 12, scientists said it had an efficacy rate of just over 50%, once people who experienced mild symptoms were included. That level is a hair above the threshold set by the World Health Organization to consider a vaccine effective. In a news conference last week, Sinovacâs chief executive officer, Yin Weidong, reiterated that the vaccine was 100% effective in preventing severe cases. He said the lower efficacy rate was a result of the trial's focus on health care workers, who had a higher propensity of contracting Covid-19 than the general population. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazilâs president and a critic of both China and its Covid-19 vaccines, pounced on the data. On Jan. 13, he mocked the vaccineâs efficacy rate, asking a supporter: âIs that 50% good?â To be sure, the Chinese vaccines have a big appeal to many countries. More than 40 countries have expressed an interest in importing Chinese vaccines, according to Chinaâs Foreign Ministry. Several world leaders, including President Reccep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and President Joko Widodo of Indonesia, have gotten a Sinovac vaccine. But the spotty and inconsistent disclosures about the vaccines remain a problem. Sinopharm, has said a vaccine candidate made by its Beijing Institute of Biological Products arm has an efficacy rate of 79%, but it did not disclose crucial details. Sinopharm didnât respond to a request for comment. In Hong Kong, a special administration region of China that has ordered 7.5 million doses of the Sinovac vaccine, officials have not received an application for emergency distribution nor any data from the Chinese company. âWhether it is because they are not making enough or if they have no plans to send the vaccines to Hong Kong yet, I donât know,â said Dr. Lau Chak Sing, who heads a Hong Kong government advisory panel on Covid-19 vaccines. Data disclosure has also been an issue in the Philippines, which has secured 25 million Sinovac vaccine doses. Risa Hontiveros, an opposition lawmaker, said President Rodrigo Duterteâs administration âcontinues to cram their preference for Chinese-made vaccines down the publicâs throat, without emergency use approval and with inconsistent data.â Leila de Lima, a senator and opposition leader who is in prison, expressed anger that the government was paying $61 a dose, more than double what Sinovacâs partner in Indonesia is paying. The presidential palace said that price was overstated but it couldnât divulge the real ones because of a confidentiality agreement. Despite the uncertainty, many people may have little choice. âIâll have my jab,â said Kayihan Pala, a member of the Turkey Medical Associationâs Covid-19 monitoring board. âI am waiting my turn, because there is no other option.â

WUHAN: Glow-in-the-dark rabbit ears, pulsating beats, and a flexible attitude to masks: nightlife in China's Wuhan is back with a vengeance almost a year after a lockdown brought life to a standstill in the city of 11 million. As the rest of the world continues to grapple with lockdowns and soaring infections, young people in the city, once the epicentre of the novel coronavirus, are enjoying their hard-earned freedom. In Super Monkey -- a huge nightclub in the city centre -- there is no dress code or VIP list. What is obligatory, at least to get through the door, is a mask and a temperature check -- any higher than 37.3 degrees Celsius and bouncers can turn prospective partygoers away. Inside, where clubbers let loose on the dancefloor amid the deafening sound of techno and a blinding laser show, the rules are not always so strictly followed. While masks are obligatory at the door, DJs and partygoers take them off to chat with friends, dance, or smoke. Many are just happy to find themselves out on the town after last year's gruelling quarantine, imposed to battle what was then a mysterious new virus. "I was stuck inside for two or three months... the country fought the virus very well, and now I can go out in complete tranquility," a man in his thirties, who identified himself as Xu, told AFP. The hedonistic vibes and champagne on ice are far from the austerity preached by authorities in Beijing. But Chen Qiang, a man in his 20s, praised the Communist Party for having practically eliminated the epidemic, despite a recent surge in cases in other parts of the country in the past few days. "The Chinese government is good. The Chinese government does everything for its people, and the people are supreme. It is different from foreign countries," he said. Beijing's state media has hammered home the failure of Western governments to tackle the virus, contrasting the chaos abroad with China's return to normal. It touts that success as evidence of the superiority of Beijing's authoritarian political model. But while many are keen to get back to a semblance of normality, Chen recognised that the virus has changed things. In the club, there are fewer people than before the pandemic, he said. Nightclub brand manager Li Bo said the virus had hit his industry hard. "Compared with other lockdowns in other countries, our country is at least half open, but the consumers still have the feeling of unease," he told AFP, estimating that nightlife in Wuhan had dropped about 60 to 70 percent. The strict rules applied by some establishments do not help, with attendee numbers limited and reservations required. Users must also show a tracking app proving they have a clean bill of health. Even that is not always enough to get in. Several AFP journalists were refused entry into the Imhan club because their apps revealed they had come from Beijing. One southern neighbourhood of China's capital has reported an infectious variant of the virus which originated in the UK. Despite the uncertainty, Wuhanites are thrilled that their city is no longer the ghost town that shocked the world a year ago. Last summer, images of a mega-party at a water park in the city were met with shock by internet users in the rest of the world, where the coronavirus continued to wreak havoc. Partygoer Xu said he now sees last spring's lockdown as a "once in a lifetime experience". "I felt lucky that I wasn't (infected with Covid-19). Now it is back to normal, I feel very relaxed and happy."

BEIJING: China said on Tuesday it will conduct military exercises in the South China Sea this week, just days after Beijing bristled at a US aircraft carrier group's entry into the disputed waters. A notice issued by the country's Maritime Safety Administration prohibited entry into a portion of waters in the Gulf of Tonkin to the west of the Leizhou peninsula in southwestern China from Jan. 27 to Jan. 30, but it did not offer details on when the drills would take place or at what scale. A US carrier group led by the USS Theodore Roosevelt entered the South China Sea on Saturday to promote "freedom of the seas," the US military said, days after Joe Biden began his term as president. The contested waters have become another flashpoint in the increasingly testy bilateral relationship between Beijing and Washington. The US military has steadily increased its activities there in recent years as China asserts its territorial claims in the area in conflict with neighbouring countries including Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan. China on Monday complained that the United States frequently sends aircraft and vessels into the South China Sea, through which trillion dollars in trade flow every year, to "flex its muscles" and said such actions are not conducive to peace and stability in the region.

RIYADH: Saudi Arabia will host a two-day Davos-style investment forum starting Wednesday, with dozens of global policy makers and business tycoons lined up to speak at the partly virtual event amid the coronavirus pandemic. Around 150 speakers will participate in the fourth edition of the Future Investment Initiative (FII), organisers said, seeking to showcase the insular kingdom as a dynamic investment destination. Around 100 speakers will participate virtually from FII hubs in New York, Paris, Beijing and Mumbai and 50 will attend the conference in-person in Riyadh, they added. The participants include Goldman Sachs chief executive David Solomon, Stephen Schwarzman, head of private equity firm Blackstone, American asset management company Blackrock's chief executive Larry Fink and former Olympic sprinter Usain Bolt, organisers said. The summit, earlier slated to be held last October, comes amid the pandemic that has battered the global economy. "There has never been a more important time for leaders, investors and policy makers to come together to work towards re-energising the global economy," Yasir al-Rumayyan, chairman of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, said in a statement. The summit, dubbed "Davos in the desert", was launched by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in 2017 to woo foreign investors and promote his Vision 2030 diversification plan to wean the economy off its dependence on petro-dollars. But the following year, the fallout over journalist Jamal Khashoggi's murder by Saudi agents in Istanbul prompted a wave of business and political leaders to pull out of the glitzy conference at the last minute. The murder at Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul triggered one of the top crude exporter's worst ever diplomatic and public relations crises. The conference saw a reboot in 2019 as global outrage over the murder subsided. The forum is billed as an economic coming-out party for the petro-state, seeking to diversify away from oil -- and authorities are eager to project the kingdom's economic ambitions.

HAIFA, Israel: When the face of 86-year-old Holocaust survivor Naomie Lichthaus appeared on their screen, staff at the call centre of Israel's Yad Ezer La-Haver foundation were ready to respond. The foundation established by Shimon Shabag in the northern port city of Haifa in 2001 has been supporting survivors of the Nazis for two decades but its mission has expanded during the Covid-19 pandemic. On Holocaust Remembrance Day, 76 years since the liberation of the Nazi extermination camp at Auschwitz, Holocaust survivors find themselves vulnerable to a virus that preys on the elderly and has forced many into painful isolation. Before the pandemic, Yad Ezer ran a home for about 100 survivors while providing food as well as medical and psychological assistance to others who lived independently. But in October it expanded to include a round-the-clock call centre with electronic monitoring, installing tablets in people's homes to allow for rapid, direct communication. "We call more than 3,500 people a day," Shabag told AFP. "We talk to them. We show them that we are here and that we're taking care of them." There are an estimated 180,000 Holocaust survivors living in Israel, according to official data. Among them is Lichthaus, who was born in Chernivtsi, a city which falls in present day Ukraine. She said when World War II broke out she was only six but would "never forget" the horror she experienced, including when men burst into her home and carried out a brutal anti-Semitic assault on her mother. She lives alone now and said her calls with Yad Ezer offer comfort. "They ask me if I need anything or if I want to talk," she said, explaining that she recently asked for a mobility walker. After disconnecting with Lichthaus, foundation volunteer Mourad Marehi was headed to her home on a motorbike to deliver the walker. "I feel more secure walking around now," Lichthaus said after receiving the delivery, her weight supported by the device. Shabag said that if someone doesn't answer a call to their tablet, "we immediately send one of our bikers" to see what's going on. On multiple occasions, the foundation has found someone lying on the floor following a stroke, a heart attack or a fall, he explained. Shabag told AFP that many survivors had been suffering from financial distress and other hardships like loneliness independent of the pandemic. The traumas brought on by the virus, especially "the fear" of lacking the essentials needed to survive, had triggered painful war-era memories, he said. The home run by Yad Ezer near the call centre is on Haifa's Kassel Street, but is known to locals as "survivors street". One resident is Holocaust survivor Haya Caspi, an 88-year-old of Romanian origin who lost her parents during the war. "It's hard because we're alone, but... we are lucky because they take care of us," she said.

JERUSALEM: Israel on Sunday said it has opened its embassy in the United Arab Emirates, following through on last year's US-brokered agreement to establish full diplomatic ties with the Gulf country. Israel's Foreign Ministry said the embassy would be in a temporary office while a permanent location is prepared. Eitan Na'eh, a veteran Israeli diplomat, will serve as the head of mission. Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said the opening of the new embassy would allow the broadening of what already are warm ties between Israel and the UAE. Since formally establishing ties in September, the two countries have already established direct flights and exchanged numerous trade delegations, while thousands of Israeli tourists have visited the UAE. The UAE was the first of four Arab countries to establish or renew ties with Israel under a series of agreements brokered by the Trump administration. The Foreign Ministry said Israel would soon open an interest section in Morocco and a consulate in Dubai. It also said an embassy in Bahrain has been operating for several weeks.

LONDON: The Egyptians who took to the streets on Jan. 25, 2011, knew what they were doing. They knew they risked arrest and worse. But as their numbers swelled in Cairo's central Tahrir Square, they tasted success. Police forces backed off, and within days, former President Hosni Mubarak agreed to demands to step down. But events didn't turn out the way many of the protesters envisioned. A decade later, thousands are estimated to have fled abroad to escape the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi that is considered even more oppressive. The significant loss of academics, artists, journalists and other intellectuals has, along with a climate of fear, hobbled any political opposition. Dr. Mohamed Aboelgheit was among those jailed in the southern city of Assiut in 2011 after joining calls for revolt against police brutality and Mubarak. He spent part of the uprising in a cramped cell. Released amid the chaos, he reveled in the atmosphere of political freedom in the Arab world's most populous country _ protesting, working as a journalist and joining a campaign for a moderate presidential candidate. But it did not last. Interim military rulers followed Mubarak. In 2012, Mohamed Morsi, a member of Egypt's most powerful Islamist group, the Muslim Brotherhood, was elected as the first civilian president in the country's history. But his tenure proved divisive. Amid massive protests, the military - led by then-Defense Minister el-Sissi - removed Morsi in 2013, dissolved parliament and eventually banned the Brotherhood as a ``terrorist group.'' A crackdown on dissent ensued, and el-Sissi won two terms in elections that human rights groups criticized as undemocratic. "I began to feel, by degree, more fear and threats," Aboelgheit said. Friends were jailed, his writings critical of the government drew attention, and ``I wasn't going to wait until it happened to me,'' he added. After el-Sissi came to power, Aboelgheit left for London, where he's published investigative reports on other parts of the Arab world. At his former home in Egypt, national security agents asked about him. When Aboelgheit's wife last returned to visit relatives, she was summoned for questioning about his activities. The message was clear. No one knows exactly how many Egyptians like Aboelgheit have fled political persecution. Data from the World Bank shows an increase in emigres from Egypt since 2011. A total of 3,444,832 left in 2017 - nearly 60,000 more than in 2013, the years for which figures are available. But it's impossible to tell economic migrants from political exiles. They relocated to Berlin, Paris and London. Egyptians also have settled in Turkey, Qatar, Sudan and even Asian countries like Malaysia and South Korea. Human Rights Watch estimated in 2019 that there were 60,000 political prisoners in Egypt. The Committee to Protect Journalists ranks Egypt third, behind China and Turkey, in detaining journalists. El-Sissi maintains Egypt has no political prisoners. The arrest of a journalist or a rights worker makes news roughly every month. Many people have been imprisoned on terrorism charges, for breaking a ban on protests or for disseminating false news. Others remain in indefinite pretrial detentions. El-Sissi maintains Egypt is holding back Islamic extremism so it doesn't descend into chaos like its neighbors. ``Sissi wants not only to abrogate the rights of the opposition and to prevent any critical voice from being uttered, Sissi doesn't actually believe, not only in the opposition, but he doesn't believe in politics,`` said Khaled Fahmy, an Egyptian professor of modern Middle Eastern History at Cambridge UniversityFahmy believes this is the worst period in Egypt's modern history for personal rights. ``It's much more serious, it's much deeper and much darker, what Sissi has in mind,'' he said. Those abroad who could challenge el-Sissi have chosen to not return. Taqadum al-Khatib, an academic who also worked in the nascent political scene after 2011, was researching Egypt's former Jewish community in Germany when he learned that returning to his homeland was no longer an option. The Egyptian cultural attache in Berlin summoned al-Khatib for a meeting, and an official questioned him about his articles, social media posts and research. He was asked to hand over his passport but refused. Shortly thereafter, he was fired from his job at an Egyptian university. He feels lucky to be able to work toward his doctorate in Germany but misses Cairo's bustle. ``It's a very difficult situation. I couldn't go back to my home,'' al-Khatib said. Fahmy said he's seen outspoken expatriates have their Egyptian citizenship revoked. A government press officer did not respond to a request for comment on targeting and intimidating Egyptians - either abroad or at home - based on their work as journalists, activists or academics, or for expressing political opinions. Journalist Asma Khatib, 29, remembers the heady days of 2011, when young people thought they could bring change. A reporter for a pro-Muslim Brotherhood news agency, Khatib covered Morsi's short presidency amid criticism the group was using violence against opponents and seeking to monopolize power to make Egypt an Islamic state. After Morsi's ouster, his supporters held sit-ins for his reinstatement at a square in Cairo. A month later, the new military leaders forcibly cleared them out, and more than 600 people were killed. Khatib documented the violence. Soon, colleagues started being arrested, and she fled Egypt - first to Malaysia, then to Indonesia and Turkey. She was tried in absentia on espionage charges in 2015, convicted and sentenced to death. Now, she and her husband Ahmed Saad, also a journalist, and their two children are seeking asylum in South Korea. They expect they'll never return, but also realize they're lucky to be free. On the day the ruling was announced, the journalist remembers telling herself: ``You don't have a country anymore.'' ``I know that there are lots of others like me. I'm not any different from those who are in prison,'' she said. The exiles have had ample time to think about where Egypt's uprising failed. The broad alliance of protesters -_ from Islamists to secular activists - fractured without a common enemy like Mubarak, and the most extreme voices became the loudest. The role of religion in society remained largely unanswered, and liberal secular initiatives never gained traction. No one accounted for how many people would embrace former regime figures, especially in a crisis. Most Egyptians abroad have not been politically active, fearing for family and friends back home. But some have continued on the path begun on Jan. 25, 2011. Tamim Heikal, working in the corporate world when the protests erupted, had doubted the government could ever reform. But he soon became a communications manager for an emerging political party. Later, he watched others being locked up, and knew his turn had come when he got an invitation from intelligence officers in 2017 to ``come have coffee.'' He booked a ticket to Paris and hasn't gone back. Now, at age 42, he wants to educate himself and others for when a popular movement re-emerges in Egypt. He makes ends meet by editing, translating and doing consulting work for rights groups, and tries to network among the diaspora. ``It's as if I was infected with a virus, after the revolution,'' he said. ``I don't know how to go back. I won't be able to relax until change happens.'' Others try to cope in strange lands. Asma Khatib and her husband aren't sure what to say to their young children when they ask where they're from. Abouelgheit, the doctor-turned-journalist, worries his son won't speak Arabic after so much time in the United Kingdom. He hopes to go home one day, but in the meantime, he's considering returning to the medical profession.

Google says North Korea-backed hackers sought cyber research

SEOUL: Google says it believes hackers backed by the North Korean government have been posing as computer security bloggers and using fake accounts on social media while attempting to steal information from researchers in the field. Google didn't specify how successful the hackers were or what kind of information could have been compromised. Experts say the attacks reflect North Korean efforts to improve its cyber skills and be able to breach widely used computer products, such as Google's Chrome internet browser and Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system. While the country has denied involvement, North Korea has been linked to major cyberattacks, including a 2013 campaign that paralysed the servers of South Korean financial institutions, the 2014 hacking of Sony Pictures, and the WannaCry malware attack of 2017. The UN ecurity Council in 2019 estimated North Korea earned as much as USD 2 billion over several years through illicit cyber operations targeting cryptocurrency exchanges and other financial transactions, generating income that is harder to trace and offsets capital lost to US-led economic sanctions over its nuclear weapons programme. Adam Weidemann, a researcher from Google's Threat Analysis Group, said in the online report published late Monday that hackers supposedly backed by North Korea created a fake research blog and multiple Twitter profiles to build credibility and interact with the security researchers they targeted. After connecting with researchers, the hackers would ask them if they wanted to collaborate on cyber-vulnerability research and share a tool that contained a code designed to install malicious software on the targets' computers, which would then allow the hackers to control the device and steal information from it. Several targeted researchers were compromised after following a Twitter link to a blog set up by the hackers, Weidemann said. âAt the time of these visits, the victim systems were running fully patched and up-to-date Windows 10 and Chrome browser versions,â Weidemann wrote. âAt this time we're unable to confirm the mechanism of compromise, but we welcome any information others might have.â Google published a list of social media accounts and websites it said were controlled by the hackers, including 10 Twitter profiles and five LinkedIn profiles. Simon Choi, a senior analyst at NSHC, a South Korean computer security firm, said cyberattacks linked to North Korea over the past few years have demonstrated an improving ability in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in computer security systems. Before 2016, the North Koreans had mainly relied on methods used by Chinese or Russian hackers, he said. âIt's notable that the computer security experts on Twitter who said they were approached by the hackers had been engaged in vulnerability research for Chrome and Windows 10,â Choi said. âIt's that not easy to successfully penetrate these systems that are built with the latest security technologies. For the North Koreans, it makes more sense to steal the vulnerabilities already discovered by the researchers because developing their own ways to exploit these systems is harder.â In 2018, US federal prosecutors charged a computer programmer working for the North Korean government for his alleged involvement in the cyberattacks that hacked Sony Pictures and unleashed the WannaCry ransomware virus. Park Jin Hyok, who is believed to be in North Korea, conspired to conduct attacks that also stole $81 million from Bangladesh's central bank, according to the charges. The 2014 Sony hack led to the release of tens of thousands of confidential Sony emails and business files. The WannaCry cyberattack in 2017 scrambled data on hundreds of thousands of computers at government agencies, banks and other businesses across the globe and crippled parts of the British health care system.

TAIPEI: A Taiwanese man has been fined 1 million New Taiwan Dollars ($ 35,000) for repeatedly breaking his home quarantine. CNN reported that the unnamed man, who lives in Taichung in central Taiwan, was under home quarantine in his apartment building after he returned from a business trip to China and violated it at least seven times, according to local media. The man left his apartment building seven times in just three days to go shopping, get his car fixed and more. He reportedly got into an altercation with one of his neighbours when they confronted him about leaving his home during quarantine, CNN citing TTV News reported. Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen denounced it as "a serious offence" and added that the man "must be given severe punishment." Along with the heavy fine, he will have to pay 3,000 NTD ($ 107) per day for the cost of his quarantine. Last year, in December, a worker from the Philippines was fined $3,500 for violating his quarantine for a total of eight seconds. The man, who was placed under quarantine in a government-sanctioned hotel, briefly stepped into the hallway outside his room and was captured on CCTV, CNN reported further. Taiwan recorded just 889 coronavirus cases and seven deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

BEIJING: The Chinese government said Wednesday that actions like its warplanes flying near Taiwan last weekend are a warning against both foreign interference in Taiwan and any independence moves by the island. Asked about the flights, Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said China's military drills are to show the nation's resolution to protect its national sovereignty and territorial integrity. "They are a stern warning against external interference and provocation from separatist forces advocating for Taiwan independence," she said at a regular briefing, giving the Chinese government's first official comment on the recent flights. China sent eight bombers and four fighter jets into Taiwan's air defense identification zone on Saturday, according to Taiwan's Defense Ministry. Taiwan scrambled fighters to monitor the activity. The US State Department later issued a statement urging China "to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan" following China's sizeable show of force. China then sent 16 military aircraft into the same area on Sunday, Taiwan said. Taiwan is a self-governing island about 160 kilometers (100 miles) off China's east coast. The Chinese government regards it as a renegade province that should be united with mainland China. Zhu said that China would not renounce the use of force to guard against separatist moves and foreign interference. "We ... reserve the option to use all necessary measures," she said. "Our position has been consistent and will not change."

TOKYO: Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga apologised on Wednesday after lawmakers from his ruling coalition visited night clubs despite his government's call for people to avoid unnecessary outings to curb the spread of Covid-19. The news is another headache for Suga whose approval rating has tumbled due to dissatisfaction with his handling of the pandemic, which critics have called too slow and inconsistent. "I'm terribly sorry that this happened when we are asking people not to eat out after 8pm and to avoid non-essential, non-urgent outings," Suga told parliament. "Each lawmaker should behave to gain the public's understanding." Japan this month issued a state of emergency in Tokyo and other areas to tame a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases. The measure includes a request for restaurants and bars to close by 8pm although there are currently no penalties for non-compliance. "My behaviour was careless at a time when we are asking people to be patient," Jun Matsumoto, a senior lawmaker from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, told reporters. Matsumoto was speaking following a Daily Shincho magazine report that he had visited two night clubs in Tokyo's posh Ginza district after dining at an Italian restaurant last Monday. Kiyohiko Toyama, a lawmaker from the coalition's junior partner Komeito, also apologised after tabloid Shukan Bunshun reported he had visited a high-end night club in Ginza until late last Friday. Twitter users voiced their frustration. "It is just a matter of time before public anger explodes. I don't want a blanket cash-payout of 100,000 yen ($965), I want them to quit! " wrote one user. "They are really stupid. Don't they think about what they are doing and how the public sees them? If they don't, they are unqualified to represent the public," said another.

ISTANBUL: A devoted dog has spent days waiting outside a hospital in northern Turkey where her sick owner was receiving treatment. The pet, Boncuk (Bon-DJUK), which means bead, followed the ambulance that transported her owner, Cemal Senturk, to hospital in the Black Sea city of Trabzon on January 14. She then made daily visits to the facility, private news agency DHA reported on Wednesday. Senturkâs daughter, Aynur Egeli, said she would take Boncuk home but the dog would repeatedly run off and return to the hospital. Hospital security guard Muhammet Akdeniz told DHA: âShe comes every day around 9am and waits until nightfall. She doesnât go in.â âWhen the door opens she pokes her head inside,â he said. On Wednesday, Boncuk was finally reunited with Senturk when he was pushed outside in a wheelchair for a brief meeting with his dog. âSheâs very used to me. And I miss her, too, constantly,â he told DHA. Senturk was discharged from the hospital later on Wednesday and returned home with Boncuk.

$1B Mega Millions prize a result of long odds, slow sales

DES MOINES: The jackpot for the Mega Millions lottery game has grown to $1 billion ahead of Friday night's drawing after more than four months without a winner thanks to bad luck, poor odds and reduced play partially blamed on the coronavirus pandemic. It's only the third time a lottery jackpot has grown so large, but much has changed since the last time such a big prize was up for grabs in 2018. The odds of winning a jackpot remain the same _ incredibly small _ but for a variety of reasons fewer people are playing Mega Millions or Powerball, the two lottery games offered in most of the country. And even as the huge Mega Millions prize and a $731.1 million Powerball jackpot won Wednesday by a single ticket sold in Maryland have juiced sales for the games, Maryland lottery director Gordon Medenica noted: ``We're not out of the woods yet.'' Medenica acknowledged sales were dramatically lower before the pandemic, and they tanked even further in the spring and summer. After a peak in October 2018, Medenica said sales of the big lottery games dropped about 50%, prompting talk among lottery officials about jackpot fatigue. Sales of Mega Millions and Powerball continued to decline after the virus hit along with other lottery games, but while scratch tickets and other instant games rebounded strongly later in the year, national game sales remained moribund. In response to falling sales, officials updated the national games to reduce starting jackpots from $40 million to $20 million and changed rules about guaranteed minimum increases between drawings. The moves made fiscal sense but they caused jackpots to grow more slowly, further tamping down sales, as demonstrated by the record 37 draws without a winner it took to reach the current Mega Millions jackpot that's still far less than the all-time highs. ``That's why it takes so many rolls to get up to a high jackpot level,'' Medenica said. What hasn't changed are the odds. By design, Mega Millions and Powerball are relatively generous in awarding small dollar prizes and lottery officials boast there is a roughly one in 24 chance of winning something. But to generate huge jackpots, officials must be absolutely miserly about paying jackpots. It's hard to fathom how unlikely it is to beat odds of one in 292.2 million for Powerball or one in 302.5 million for Mega Millions. To get a sense of your chances, Steven Bleiler, a mathematics and statistics professor at Portland State University, said people should imagine a swimming pool 40 feet (12.2 meters) wide, 120 feet (36.6 meters) long and 5 feet (1.5 meters) deep, filled to the brim with M&Ms, only one of which is green. To win, all a player must do is jump in blindfolded and wade around until finding that single green candy. Andrew Swift, a mathematics professor at the University of Nebraska-Omaha, put it this way: Your chances of picking up two oysters and finding a pearl in both is about twice as likely as winning either lottery jackpot. Still, someone always ultimately wins, and it happened again after Wednesday night's Powerball drawing when a single ticket sold at a convenience store in the small community of Lonaconing, Maryland, hit all six numbers. The winner can take a $716.3 annuity paid over 30 years or a cash prize of $546.8 million. What comes next is unclear. Some states are banking on growth in online games, but while the 10 states that allow purchases on computers and phone apps are seeing rising sales, such purchases remain a relatively small percentage of overall revenue. ``The current roll has revived the game as it's been designed,'' Medenica said. ``Whether we continue to consider making changes or not is to be seen.''

A law to crow about: France upholds rural 'sensory heritage'

PARIS: From crowing roosters to the whiff of barnyard animals, the "sensory heritage" of France's countryside will now be protected by law from attempts to stifle the everyday aspects of rural life from newcomers looking for peace and quiet. French senators on Thursday gave final approval to a law proposed in the wake of several high-profile conflicts by village residents and vacationers, or recent arrivals derided as "neo-rurals". A rowdy rooster named Maurice in particular made headlines in 2019 after a court in western France rejected a bid to have him silenced by neighbours who had purchased a holiday home nearby. "Living in the countryside implies accepting some nuisances," Joel Giraud, the government's minister in charge of rural life, told lawmakers. Cow bells (and cow droppings), grasshopper chirps and noisy early-morning tractors are also now considered part of France's natural heritage that will be codified in its environmental legislation. "It sends a strong message," said Pierre-Antoine Levi, the senator who acted as rapporteur for the bill. "It can act as a useful tool for local officials as they carry out their educational and mediation duties," he said. The law is emblematic of growing tensions in the countryside between longtime residents and outsiders whose bucolic expectations often clash with everyday realities. Corinne Fesseau and her rooster Maurice became the image of the fight when she was brought to court by pensioners next door over the animal's shrill wake-up calls. Critics saw the lawsuit as part of a broader threat to France's hallowed rural heritage by outsiders and city dwellers unable or unwilling to understand the realities of country life. Thousands of people signed a "Save Maurice" petition, and a judge eventually upheld the cock-a-doodle-doos. In another case from 2019, a woman in the duck-breeding heartland of the Landes region was brought to court by a newcomer neighbour fed up with the babbling of the ducks and geese in her back garden. A court in southwest France also threw out that case.

PARIS: Frenchwoman Jeanne Pouchain has an unusual problem. Sheâs officially dead. She has been trying for three years to prove that she is alive. The 58-year-old woman says she lives in constant fear, not daring to leave her house in the village of Saint Joseph, in the Loire region. Authorities seized her car over an unpaid debt she contests and which is at the center of her troubles. She fears the family furniture will be next. Pouchainâs status has prevented her and her husband, who is her legal beneficiary along with her son, from using their joint bank account. Being declared deceased has deprived her of other critical amenities. Pouchainâs status as deceased is the result of a 2017 Lyon court decision that deemed her dead even though no death certificate was produced. The decision came at the end of a legal dispute with an employee of Pouchainâs former cleaning company, who was seeking compensation after losing her job 20 years ago. According to Pouchain and her attorney, snowballing judicial errors ended with the 2017 ruling by the Appeals Court of Lyon that Pouchain was not among the living. The legal imbroglio is all the stranger because, Pouchain contended, neither she nor her relatives got summons for the hearing. Cormier, her attorney, filed an unusual motion last Monday to invalidate the 2017 decision by the Lyon appeals court due to a âgrave errorâ by the judges. He said he has never before dealt with such a âcrazyâ case.

WASHINGTON: An Indian national has pleaded guilty to conspiracy and identity theft in connection with an overseas robocall scam that defrauded thousands in the US, mostly elderly people, of nearly $8 million, the Department of Justice said. Shehzadkhan Pathan, 39, operated a call centre in Gujarat's Ahmedabad that placed automated robocalls to victims in the United States, as per court documents. After establishing contact with the victims through these automated calls, Pathan and other "closers" at his call centre would coerce, cajole, and trick victims to send bulk cash through physical shipments and electronic money transfers, federal prosecutors alleged. Pathan and his conspirators used a variety of schemes to convince victims to send money, including impersonating law enforcement officers from the FBI and DEA and representatives of other government agencies such as the Social Security Administration, to threaten victims with severe legal and financial consequences. Conspirators also convinced the victims to send money as initial installments for falsely promised loans, the court documents said. According to the court papers, Pathan also recruited and supervised several money mules, who he directed to receive money sent by the victims. His network of money mules was located in multiple states, including but not limited to Virginia, New Jersey, Minnesota, Texas, California, South Carolina, and Illinois. Pathan assigned various aliases to these individuals and supplied them with hundreds of counterfeit identification documents to facilitate their receipt of cash shipments and money transfers. He then directed the money mules to send the money to himself and other conspirators through various means, including cash deposits into numerous bank accounts and via informal money transmitters known as hawalas, the prosecutors alleged. The Department of Justice said Pathan's scams disproportionately targeted elderly victims, many of whom suffered substantial financial hardship. In total, Pathan is responsible for defrauding over 5,000 US victims of at least $8 million, it added. His sentencing is scheduled for May 14. Pathan faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for the conspiracy, along with a mandatory consecutive term of two years for aggravated identity theft.

WASHINGTON: Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna on Saturday hoped for a peaceful and fair solution to the farmers' issues in India, saying he is encouraged by the ongoing dialogue between the protesting farmers and the government. Khanna, 44, was recently elected for a third consecutive term from the congressional district representing Silicon Valley. âIndia and the US share a rich tradition of democracy and peaceful protests. Farmworkers are the backbone of both our nations and must have their voices heard. I hope there's a peaceful and fair solution so they can provide for their families,â Khanna said in a tweet on Saturday. âI am encouraged by the ongoing dialogue,â he said, joining other American lawmakers who have expressed their views on the ongoing farmers' protest in India, several of whom have expressed their concerns. âAs Co-Chair of the American Sikh Caucus in Congress, my office has received first-hand accounts of the horrific crackdowns on protestors who are trying to peacefully express their disapproval of India's recent agricultural reform legislation,â said Congressman John Garamendi, who along with two other lawmakers wrote a letter to India's Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu early this week. According to the letter, âhundreds of thousands of farmers from the states of Punjab and Haryana that have made their way to New Delhi to peacefully protest these new agricultural laws, and the Indian government has met these peaceful protestors with tear gas, water cannons, barricades, baton attacks, and more. âMany of these farmers have children, relatives, and friends who are US citizens, many of whom have reached out to us to share their concerns about these developments. We urge the Indian government to demonstrate its respect for these crucial democratic freedoms, and to be a model of democratic values in the vital Indo-Pacific regionâ. The letter, dated December 4, was released this week. The two other lawmakers who have expressed their concern on the protest were congressman Jim Costa and congresswoman Shelia Jackson Lee, members of the American Sikh Caucus. Thousands of farmers are currently staying put at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. There have been multiple rounds of talks between representatives of the protestors and the government but the logjam continues.

Indian-American in Time's 'Heroes of 2020' for giving shelter to 70 George Floyd protesters

NEW YORK: Indian-American Rahul Dubey, who had opened the doors of his Washington DC home to over 70 people demonstrating against the killing of George Floyd, has been hailed among the "Heroes of 2020" by the TIME magazine, honouring those who "went above and beyond the call of duty" this year.  In the 'Heroes of 2020', the publication also named Australia's volunteer firefighters who risked everything to keep their country safe, food-stall owners Jason Chua and Hung Zhen Long in Singapore who wouldn't let anyone go hungry during the Covid-19 pandemic, Pastor Reshorna Fitzpatrick and her husband Bishop Derrick Fitzpatrick of Chicago, who transformed their church to support their community during the trying year.  A newspaper deliveryman Greg Dailey, who began a grocery drop-off service in mid-March to anyone in need along his paper route and has since supplied more than 140 homes and conducted over 1,000 grocery runs in New Jersey's Mercer county, was also named by the magazine.  "From citizens providing food and shelter to those in need to volunteers who protected their neighbours from natural disasters, these heroes went above and beyond the call of duty in 2020," TIME said.  TIME described Dubey as "The Man Who Gave Shelter to Those in Need."  On June 1, as demonstrators filled the streets of Washington DC to protest the killing of African-American Floyd, Dubey was home, not far from the White House.  After a 7 PM curfew, he noticed crowds in the street outside as "police had set up barricades seemingly to trap protesters, and were pepper-spraying those who remained. Dubey decided to take action," TIME said.  "I open my door, and I start yelling, 'Get in!'" says Dubey, who works in the health care sector. "All these people were swarming in."  Dubey said he gave about 70 protesters refuge in his home, housing them overnight to avoid curfew breaches.  "People were coughing, crying, strangers pouring milk into strangers' eyes," Dubey said.  "They were sharing information, writing down numbers for bail bondsmen. It was this real camaraderie."  A report in TIME said Dubey claims police officers made several attempts to breach his sanctuary that evening: posing as protesters trying to get inside, and attempting to intercept the pizza delivery he had ordered for his houseguests.  The move to open his door was driven by instinct, Dubey says nearly six months later. "It's what was needed."  For his act, Dubey had been hailed as a hero and saviour as those who took shelter in his house started tweeting about it.  "Rahul saved lives last night," one Black Lives Matter activist had written on Twitter.  "He ended this with an inspirational speech about not giving up and keeping up the peaceful fight. What a guy. Thank you, Rahul."  Dubey had told BuzzFeed News that it wasn't a choice to open his door and provide refuge to the mostly young protesters.  "If you had seen what was going on in front of my eyes, there was no choice. People were getting pepper-sprayed and beaten and slammed to the ground," he had told the media outlet.  "I hope that my 13-year-old son grows up to be just as amazing as they are," Dubey was quoted as saying by WJLA news.  Floyd, 46, died in Minneapolis on May 25 when a white police officer pinned him to the ground and knelt on his neck as he gasped for breath.  The footage, which went viral, showed Floyd pleading with the officer, saying he can't breathe. The four police officers seen in the footage have since been charged.  His death triggered nationwide violent protests with a section of the protesters resorting to looting and rioting across the country, leaving behind a trail of destruction.

NEW YORK: Indian-American Rahul Dubey, who had opened the doors of his Washington DC home to over 70 people demonstrating against the killing of George Floyd, has been hailed among the "Heroes of 2020" by the TIME magazine, honouring those who "went above and beyond the call of duty" this year.  In the 'Heroes of 2020', the publication also named Australia's volunteer firefighters who risked everything to keep their country safe, food-stall owners Jason Chua and Hung Zhen Long in Singapore who wouldn't let anyone go hungry during the Covid-19 pandemic, Pastor Reshorna Fitzpatrick and her husband Bishop Derrick Fitzpatrick of Chicago, who transformed their church to support their community during the trying year.  A newspaper deliveryman Greg Dailey, who began a grocery drop-off service in mid-March to anyone in need along his paper route and has since supplied more than 140 homes and conducted over 1,000 grocery runs in New Jersey's Mercer county, was also named by the magazine.  "From citizens providing food and shelter to those in need to volunteers who protected their neighbours from natural disasters, these heroes went above and beyond the call of duty in 2020," TIME said.  TIME described Dubey as "The Man Who Gave Shelter to Those in Need."  On June 1, as demonstrators filled the streets of Washington DC to protest the killing of African-American Floyd, Dubey was home, not far from the White House.  After a 7 PM curfew, he noticed crowds in the street outside as "police had set up barricades seemingly to trap protesters, and were pepper-spraying those who remained. Dubey decided to take action," TIME said.  "I open my door, and I start yelling, 'Get in!'" says Dubey, who works in the health care sector. "All these people were swarming in."  Dubey said he gave about 70 protesters refuge in his home, housing them overnight to avoid curfew breaches.  "People were coughing, crying, strangers pouring milk into strangers' eyes," Dubey said.  "They were sharing information, writing down numbers for bail bondsmen. It was this real camaraderie."  A report in TIME said Dubey claims police officers made several attempts to breach his sanctuary that evening: posing as protesters trying to get inside, and attempting to intercept the pizza delivery he had ordered for his houseguests.  The move to open his door was driven by instinct, Dubey says nearly six months later. "It's what was needed."  For his act, Dubey had been hailed as a hero and saviour as those who took shelter in his house started tweeting about it.  "Rahul saved lives last night," one Black Lives Matter activist had written on Twitter.  "He ended this with an inspirational speech about not giving up and keeping up the peaceful fight. What a guy. Thank you, Rahul."  Dubey had told BuzzFeed News that it wasn't a choice to open his door and provide refuge to the mostly young protesters.  "If you had seen what was going on in front of my eyes, there was no choice. People were getting pepper-sprayed and beaten and slammed to the ground," he had told the media outlet.  "I hope that my 13-year-old son grows up to be just as amazing as they are," Dubey was quoted as saying by WJLA news.  Floyd, 46, died in Minneapolis on May 25 when a white police officer pinned him to the ground and knelt on his neck as he gasped for breath.  The footage, which went viral, showed Floyd pleading with the officer, saying he can't breathe. The four police officers seen in the footage have since been charged.  His death triggered nationwide violent protests with a section of the protesters resorting to looting and rioting across the country, leaving behind a trail of destruction.

WASHINGTON: Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal has been elected as the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), making her one of the most powerful US lawmakers in the 117th Congress. Jayapal, 55, who was elected on Wednesday, said that the caucus is going to advance racial justice, tackle poverty and inequality and help transform the country. "As a lifelong organiser, I am honoured that my colleagues have elected me to lead the Congressional Progressive Caucus at this pivotal moment," Jayapal said soon after her election to this most powerful Congressional Caucus, which is slated to play an influential role during the next Biden Administration. Joe Biden, 78, is due to take over as the 46th president of the US on January 20. "We have massive crises knocking at our nation's door, and the work of the Progressive Caucus has never been more important. The American people need Congress to lead with vision, conviction, empathy, and dedication to people and families in every community who are struggling right now," said Jayapal. The incoming Executive Board of CPC is made up of 26 members - one Chair, one Deputy Chair, one Whip, two Chair Emeriti, two Special Order Hour Conveners, ten Vice Chairs, one Executive Board Member At-Large and eight Deputy Whips. The CPC Executive Board is representative of the diversity within the caucus - more than half of Executive Board members are people of colour and more than half are women. Incoming CPC Deputy Chair Congresswoman Katie Porter said that in 2018, many of her Democratic colleagues and she successfully ran campaigns rooted in progressive values. "Rather than shying away from our core principles, we embraced them- making it clear that a progressive agenda is not only the right policy for America, but also a winning political message," she said. CPC Whip Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said, "we have a unique opportunity to fight for transformative change in the 117th Congress- whether that is addressing the coronavirus pandemic, passing universal healthcare, tackling the climate crisis or reorienting our foreign policy." "I look forward to continuing to represent my colleagues in building an effect progressive voting bloc in Congress alongside fearless leaders like Reps. Pramila Jayapal and Katie," she said. Among others, Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna has been elected as Deputy Whip, while Congresswoman Rashida Talib as vice chair for member services. "We have massive crises knocking at our nation's door and our work has never been more important. It's time for Congress to act boldly and restore power to where it belongs: with the people," Jayapal said in a tweet. "Together, our caucus is going to deliver real relief to families, advance racial justice, tackle poverty and inequality, champion climate justice, and help transform this country so working people can finally get ahead. Let's get to work," Jayapal said.

LONDON: An 87-year-old man and his 83-year-old wife from the north east of England on Tuesday became the first Indian-origin couple in the world to get a vaccine against Covid-19, after they got injected with their first of two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab at a hospital in Newcastle. Dr Hari Shukla, a race relations campaigner based in Tyne and Wear, had been contacted by the National Health Service (NHS) based on the criteria set for the world's first vaccine to receive regulatory approvals in the UK last week. His wife, Ranjan, then volunteered for the jab as she also falls within the first phase of people aged 80 and over, care home workers as well as NHS workers at high risk eligible to receive the "life-saving jab". "Hari Shukla and his wife Ranjan have become the first two patients at Newcastle Hospitals â and two of the first people in the world â to receive the Covid-19 vaccine," Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said. They join 90-year-old Margaret "Maggie" Keenan from Coventry as the very first in the world to receive her shot, followed by 81-year-old William Shakespeare in Warwickshire as the second. "I'm so pleased we are hopefully coming towards the end of this pandemic and I am delighted to be doing my bit by having the vaccine, I feel it is my duty to do so and do whatever I can to help," said Shukla, who was born in Kenya and whose father hailed from Mumbai. "Having been in contact with the NHS [National Health Service], I know how hard they all work and the greatest respect for them â they have a heart of gold and I am grateful for everything they have done to keep us safe during the pandemic," he said. Shukla, who has been honoured with an MBE, OBE and CBE for his work as the Director of the Tyne and Wear Race Equality Council over the years, was notified by the NHS based on the criteria set by the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation as part of a phased rollout plan based on those at the highest risk of death from the deadly virus. "Today marks a huge step forward in the UK's fight against coronavirus, as we begin delivering the vaccine to the first patients across the whole country. I am immensely proud of the scientists who developed the vaccine, members of the public who took part in trials, and the NHS who have worked tirelessly to prepare for rollout,â said British Prime Minister Prime Johnson. However, he struck a note of caution to warn that mass vaccination will take time and urged the public to remain "clear-eyed" and continue to follow the lockdown rules over the winter months ahead. The NHS said it is undertaking the biggest and most highly anticipated immunisation campaign in history at 50 hospital hubs, with more starting vaccinations over the coming weeks and months as the programme ramps up after the first set of doses arrived from Pfizer's manufacturing site in Belgium. "We will look back on today, V-day, as a key moment in our fight back against this terrible disease, and I am proud our health services across the United Kingdom are about to embark on our largest ever vaccination programme,â said Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who got teary eyed during television interviews on Tuesday as he declared he felt "proud to be British". Since the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine got the green light from the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) last week, the NHS said its workers have been working around the clock to manage the large-scale logistical challenge of deploying the vaccine. "Coronavirus is the greatest health challenge in NHS history, taking loved ones from us and disrupting every part of our lives," said Sir Simon Stevens, NHS Chief Executive. "The deployment of this vaccine marks a decisive turning point in the battle with the pandemic. NHS vaccination programmes which have successfully helped overcome tuberculosis, polio, and smallpox, now turn their focus to coronavirus. NHS staff are proud to be leading the way as the first health service in the world to begin vaccination with this Covid jab," he said. The MHRA has stressed that the vaccine has been cleared for mass rollout only after "rigorous" safety tests despite the process being speeded up due to the urgency of finding an effective vaccine against a pandemic which has wreaked havoc around the world. NHS national medical director, Professor Stephen Powis, has warned that the roll out of a vaccine will be a "marathon" not a sprint. The Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at -70C before being thawed out and can only be moved four times within that cold chain before being used. General Practitioners (GPs) and other primary care staff have also been put on standby to start delivering the jab on a phased basis. Vaccination centres treating large numbers of patients in sporting venues and conference centres will subsequently start up when further supplies of vaccine come on stream, with a bulk of the rollout expected in the early part of the New Year.

LONDON: UK PM Boris Johnson on Friday backed Priti Patel, one of his most senior ministers, after a damning inquiry into allegations that she bullied her staff concluded she had broken rules, including shouting and swearing at them. Johnson's defence of the Indian-origin home secretary prompted the author of the report, independent adviser Alex Allan, to resign. Patel had not met the standards set under Britain's ministerial code which states ministers should treat officials with respect, Allan had concluded. Ministers usually step down if they are found to be in breach of the code. However, a government statement said Johnson judged the code had not been breached, saying that concerns had not been raised at the time and that Patel was unaware of the impact of her actions. "The PM has full confidence in home secretary and considers this matter now closed," it said. Patel had been accused of demeaning her staff, prompting Johnson to launch an inquiry in March to establish the facts. In a summary of his advice, Allan found that Patel had become "justifiably in many instances" frustrated by her department's lack of support, and this had "manifested itself in forceful expression, including some occasions of shouting and swearing". "Her approach on occasions has amounted to behaviour that can be described as bullying...," Allan's advice said. Patel thanked PM for his support and said, "I am sorry that my behaviour in the past has upset people. I acknowledge that I have at times got frustrated." Colleagues rallied round her, describing her as kind. However, Keir Starmer, the leader of Labour Party, said he would have sacked her. Patel had to quit as aid minister in 2017 because she held undisclosed meetings with Israeli officials.

WASHINGTON: Outgoing President Donald Trump has left America more divided than ever and the country's reputation under his presidency has been damaged on the international stage which will take years to repair, says an influential Indian-American Sikh leader. âThis is a democracy at work, on both sides. Whether Democrat or Republicanâ¦ people are excited and want to speak out. The election's historic turnout means people are hungry to change the status quo on both sides. âWe are more polarised and divided than I have ever seen being an American for 25 years. I believe people do care who will represent them, especially in times like the Covid-19 pandemic,â Indiana-based Gurinder Singh Khalsa told PTI. A recipient of the prestigious Rosa Parks Trailblazer Award in recognition of his efforts in changing the Transportation Security Administration's policy regarding turbans, 46-year-old Khalsa, though a member of Republican party, did not vote for Trump in this election or in 2016. âI do not think he is morally or ethically fit to be president, especially the leader of the free world. I came to America by choice; for dignity and respect. For the first time as an American, I have felt challenged on those values,â he said. Though he is disillusioned with the current state of affairs of the Republican Party, Khalsa said he has no plan on leaving the GOP. âI do not think the issues lie within the party. It is those like Trump who have twisted the foundation of what it means to be a Republican,â he said. On the election of Indian-origin Kamala Harris as Vice President of the country, Khalsa said that it gives confidence to the people of color and immigrant community. âKamala Harris is a powerful accomplishment for America and provides a ray of hope for relations with India. And her win is just the beginning,â he said. One of the early supporters of Vice President Mike Pence when he was running for Indiana Governor, Khalsa said he is deeply disappointed at the four years of Trump Administration. He alleged that Trump's rhetoric has directly encouraged racism and sexism. âAnd he continues to feed into the narrative of white against black, and poor against rich,â he said. Responding to a question, Khalsa said that it is time for the Indian American community to be active in politics and serve the community they live in. âYou need to give back by serving the community, in whatever capacity you can. One thing to keep in mind is that democracy is not a constant; it needs to be monitored and respected or it will slip away,â he said. In 2007, Khalsa was refused access to board an airplane because of his turban. Thereafter, he mobilised more than 67,000 people nationwide for petitions and took the matter all the way to the US Congress, which forced the Transportation and Security Administration (TSA) to change its headgear policy towards the Sikh community.

Hospitals and health centres across several cities and towns in many states and UTs could not achieve their Covid-19 vaccination targets on Tuesday thanks to continuing hesitancy among health workers in taking the shot, with a section of doctors in hospitals in Hyderabad even writing letters to their superiors, saying they would rather wait for more options before they take a jab. Reports of several cases of adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) were among the factors which caused health workers to skip the inoculations despite their names listed at the centres. âThereâre cases of adverse effects being reported for the available vaccines and one is still under trial,â read a letter by a senior resident at Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (TIMS) in Hyderabad, referring to Covaxin. âI prefer to wait until there is a better vaccine available,â the doctor said in the letter. As many as 67 health workers at TIMS refused to take the jab on Tuesday. âIf I take the vaccine now, I will not be able to take another vaccine in the near future, which might have better efficacy,â wrote a senior doctor from Osmania General Hospital, where less than 200 out of the 600 beneficiaries listed took the vaccine Scores of health workers skipped inoculation in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad in Maharashtra because of hesitancy. The deputy director for health services, Sanjay Deshmukh, said the refusals were due to anxiety over safety and efficacy of the vaccines. In Nagpurâs Government Medical College and Hospital, the exclusive centre for Covaxin in the city, only 29 out of 100 beneficiaries took the jab on Tuesday.

OSLO/ NORWAY: Twenty-three people died in Norway within days of receiving their first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine with 13 of those deaths apparently related to the side effects of the shots, New York Post reported citing the health officials. All 13 were nursing home patients and at least 80 years old. Common reactions to the vaccine, including fever and nausea, "may have contributed to a fatal outcome in some frail patients," New York Post quoted Sigurd Hortemo, chief physician at the Norwegian Medicines Agency, as saying in a statement on Friday. While officials aren't expressing serious concern, they are adjusting their guidance on who should receive the vaccine. More than 30,000 people in Norway have received the first shot of the Pfizer or Moderna coronavirus vaccine since late last month. Agency's medical director Steinar Madsen has stated that the "agency is not alarmed by this." "It is quite clear that these vaccines have very little risk, with a small exception for the frailest patients. Doctors must now carefully consider who should be vaccinated. Those who are very frail and at the very end of life can be vaccinated after an individual assessment," he said. The agency reported Thursday that a total of 29 people had suffered side effects, including the 13 people who died. Twenty-one women and eight men experienced side effects, officials said. Besides those who died, nine had serious side effects -- including allergic reactions, strong discomfort and severe fever -- while seven had less serious ones, including severe pain at the injection site, New York Post reported. According to health officials around 400 people die each week in the nursing home population. A Pfizer rep said the company is "aware of reported deaths" following the administration of the vaccine in Norway and is working with the Norwegian Medicines Agency to gather all the relevant information. The total number of coronavirus cases reported in Norway is 58,202, while the death toll stands at 517, according to the Johns Hopkins University

PATNA: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday indirectly hinted that he might get removed midway like Karpoori Thakur because he has been working for the welfare and progress of all sections of the society just like the veteran socialist leader. âKarpoori Thakur Ji, as the CM, worked for the welfare of all sections of the society but he was removed from the post within two years. We too are working in the interest of all sections of society. Sometimes, some people get annoyed because of working in the interest of all sections of the society,â Nitish said while addressing an event organised at the JD(U) office to commemorate Jannayak Karpoori Thakur on his birth anniversary. Born in a very poor family of barbers, Thakur rose to the post of Bihar CM twice. First time, he took oath as the CM on December 22, 1970 but had to quit the post on June 2, 1971 within a period of six months. He became the CM for the second time on June 24, 1977 but again he was compelled to quit the post April 21, 1979 before completion of even two years in the office. Nitish was referring to Thakurâs second term as the CM. Recalling how he has been observing the birth anniversary of Jannayak Karpoori Ji ever since he became the MLA for the first time, Nitish also said he had been trying his best to implement the thoughts of Thakur. The event was organized by the JD(U)âs Extremely Backward Classes (EBC) cell at âKapoori Bhawanâ in the JD(U) office in Patna. The CM also said his party- JD(U) and its workers were marching ahead after adopting the ideals of great leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, Ram Manohar Lohia, Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan and Karpoori Thakur. "We did work for the development of all regions of the state and people of all strata of the society by working on the principle of âDevelopment with Justice.â Whatever policies we framed, they benefited all sections of the society,â Nitish said. "Since the first day of my coming into power in November 2005, several schemes were implemented to ensure progress of the people belonging to the SC, ST, minorities, extremely backward classes and women. Some special initiatives were taken to bring the people living on the margins, in the mainstream of the society. Women were provided 50% reservation in the panchayati raj institutions to provide them adequate representation at the grassroots level,â Nitish said while recalling how his government since 2005 did so many works to ensure progress of all sections of the society. Reminding the people about the bad governance of Lalu-Rabri regime, Nitish said every senior person in the state knew as to what was the situation during the previous regime. âWhat was the situation earlier? People did not used to come out of their home after the sunset. What was the condition of roads in those days?â Nitish quipped and asked the party men to inform the new generation about the dark days of the previous governments in Bihar. On this occasion, the JD(U) also decided to name its all district and block level offices after Karpoori Thakur. âHenceforth, all JD(U) offices at the district and block level will be known as âKarpoori Bhawanâ,â the partyâs state general secretary Navin Kumar Arya said. The JD(U) national president RCP Singh and many senior party leaders also addressed the event.

BENGALURU: With the government staying mum on a decision to reopen primary classes, educationists and stakeholders are beginning to up the ante, seeking immediate action on the issue. âVidyarthigala Nade Shaleya Kadeâ, a group comprising stakeholders, educationists and health experts that has been seeking reopening of schools for months now, has already chalked out their next course of action â to leave children on school campuses from February 1. The group has been vociferous on the issue and had earlier put pressure on the government by shooting videos of schoolchildren demanding reopening of schools in December. The government then allowed campuses to reopen for classes 10 and 12 from January 1, while on-campus Vidyagama sessions for classes 6-9 also began the same day. At that time, the government had said it will decide on throwing open campuses for other classes after 15 days, depending on the situation. VP Niranjanaradhya, Centre for Child and Law, NLSIU, who is batting for schools to reopen, said about the campaign: âWe had initially planned to start the new campaign on Monday (January 25), but have decided to wait till February 1. As per the campaign, parents will leave their children on campus when they leave for work as they believe itâs the safest place for their children. School development monitoring committees have requested the cooperation of teachers to look after children.â He went on to say, âUnlike older children, primary school graders will not be able to manage lessons by themselves. They need guidance from teachers. When the Supreme Court has said even anganwadis can open, why is the government still hesitating on opening schools?â Moydeen Kutty, president, School Development Monitoring Committee Coordination Forum, said: âChildren, and their parents, have been sitting at home for almost a year now with no learning happening. Parents are unable to go to work as they have no place to send their children. Those homes where parents used to go to work leaving the younger child in the care of an older sibling are also in a dilemma now as older children are back in school.â The worry is also about providing midday meals. Dr Srinivas Kakkilaya, physician and activist, said: âWorld over, schools have reopened and classes for grades 10 and 12 have begun here too. Have Covid-19 cases increased after schools reopened? It has been proved time and again that children between 3 and 10 years of age are the least affected by Covid-19. For young children, school is not just about academics; it is also about learning social skills. Inadequate nutrition has also been a major concern. Itâs time the government provides straight answers.â The department of public instruction has said it has already recommended to the government to resume oncampus classes for grades 9 and 11. âItâs up to the government now. Reopening classes 6 to 8 have been discussed orally. However, we are moving cautiously on reopening for primary grades,â said V Anbukkumar, commissioner.

SURAT: His heart ailment, diabetes and other diseases donât give this 63-year-old farmer sleepless nights. Itâs the sheer agony of his sixth wife, 21 years younger to him, refusing to share bed that causes him all the heartache. When people were desperately seeking some panacea for coronavirus in September last year, Ayyub Degiya was determinedly hunting for a seventh wife, after almost five months into his sixth but unconsummated marriage. Degiya, a wealthy farmer from Kapletha village in Surat district, got married for the sixth time in September 2020 and separated in December after the younger woman allegedly refrained from keeping a physical relationship with him. âShe did not allow me to sleep with her. She used to complain of infection. I have heart disease, diabetes and other diseases. I need a wife who can keep a relationship with me,â Degiya told TOI. Degiyaâs first wife is alive and lives in the same village with their five children, aged between 20 and 35 years. The 42-year-old Rander woman, a widow, did a background check on Degiya and was shocked to discover that she was biwi no. 6. Last week, she lodged a complaint against him in Mahila police station. The accused has been booked under IPC section 498-A (cruelty to married woman). âHe got married to more than five women before marrying me but kept me in the dark. After deserting me, he is now living with another woman even when his first wife is alive. I was told by some villagers that he keeps relations for a few months with women and later abandons them,â the complainant told TOI. Chandresh Jobanputra, her lawyer, added, âIn December, Degiya dropped the woman at her sister's house in Rander saying he was going out of town. He assured to pick her up upon return. But he never came back and hence she approached the police.â Jobanputra said Degiya initially approached her family claiming that he wants to marry and support the woman as she is a widow. He said it was permissible under their faith. He promised to give her Rs two lakh worth jewellery and a house, a promise which he allegedly reneged upon. Degiya, however, could not give a satisfactory reply when asked why he separated from all his previous wives. Asmita Pargi, investigation officer at Mahila police station said, âDegiya told us that he does not wish to live with the woman as she is unfit to fulfil his physical demands. Further action will be taken after registering statements of all those concerned.

MUMBAI: In an unusual instance, a 53-year-old woman from Goregaon has been booked for insulting the modesty of her 36-year-old neighbour. The accused allegedly taunted the victim repeatedly for her short hair, clothes and called her a âeunuchâ. The victim, a general manager with a private company, had moved as a tenant to the apartment complex in December 2020. An FIR was registered against the accused woman, a tiffin supplier, on Saturday under IPC sections 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and 500 (defamation). âMy client was subjected to gross harassment at the instance of her neighbour, a woman, by uttering words and exhibiting gestures of extremely derogatory nature that would amount to outraging and tarnishing modesty of any woman only because sheâs a single woman living as a tenant independently and has a âbob cutâ. The matter is currently under investigation,â the victimâs lawyer Siddhesh Borkar said. In her statement to the police, the victim said that for the first few days after she moved into the building, she had availed tiffin service from the accused. However, since she did not like the food, she stopped the service and settled her dues. The woman said on December 12 when the accused was not home, her son hosted a party. âThe music was being loudly played till 3.30 am, so I went to the door twice and requested them to turn down the volume. After that I stopped interacting and talking to the family,â the victim said. She alleged the accused, in retaliation, started taunting her for her short hair. The victim alleged she would stand outside her house and make comments to humiliate her such as âI donât know if she is a psycho, a girl or a boy? Her voice is like that of a dog.â She even went to the extent of slut-shaming her. The victim said this went on for a month, but she ignored her. The matter escalated on January 11 when the victim was visiting another neighbour. She said the accused first commented on her trousers and loudly questioned if she had soiled it by wetting herself. The accused even followed her to her friendâs house and started abusing her loudly. The victim alleged she called her names such âprostituteâ and âslutâ, questioned her gender and even abused her parents. She accused her of inviting and soliciting men at the house. The accused told her she was a tenant and should live like one. The victim said she then contacted a policeman who lived in the building. He advised her to call up the 100 police helpline. With the harassment allegedly continuing even after that, the victim finally lodged an FIR.

LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday held the BJP-led central government responsible for turning farmers' "resentment into anger" and demanded immediate withdrawal of new agri laws. His remarks come after clashes broke out at multiple places during the farmers' tractor parade in Delhi on Tuesday. Tens of thousands of protesters broke through barriers, fought with police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the iconic Red Fort. "The way the BJP government has continuously neglected, humiliated and accused the farmers, it played a decisive role in turning the resentment of the farmers into anger. Only the BJP is responsible for the present situation," Yadav said in a tweet in Hindi. He said the government should immediately withdraw the farm laws considering it as its moral responsibility.

UNITED NATIONS: India has announced a pledge of $150,000 to activities of the Peacebuilding Fund this year and said that 2021 provides the international community with an opportunity to look at peacebuilding in a more focused manner, especially in the context of the Covid pandemic. âWhile I would like to assure you all of our sincere commitment to remain engaged in peacebuilding, we extend our support to the activities of the Peacebuilding Fund and as a token of our engagement, India would like to announce today a pledge of $150,000 to the fund's activities and programme this year,â India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti said. In a virtual address to the High-Level Replenishment Conference for the United Nations Peacebuilding Fund Tuesday, he said India believes that 2021 provides the international community with an opportunity to look at peacebuilding in the broader context and in a more focused manner, especially in the context of the Covid pandemic, which is threatening to erode the gains made over the years. He added that the recently concluded 2020 review of the UN peacebuilding architecture provides a framework to strengthen peace building collectively. He voiced appreciation that as a part of its 2020-24 strategy, the Peacebuilding Fund has put forth a comprehensive scenario covering a horizon of five years. The Fund requires 1.5 billion dollars for 2020-2024. âThere is no doubt that conflict prevention is essential to ensure that peacekeeping translates into something more durable for the benefit of the people,â he said, adding that for this determined support is needed from member states to strengthen the hands of the United Nations. He emphasised that strengthening security structures go hand in hand with strengthening civilian structures of good governance. âWe need to consequently prioritise our focus on specific aspects of peacebuilding, which will have the highest impact in post-conflict situations, so that the funds are utilised to the optimum.â UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said at the conference that peacebuilding in fragile contexts requires political courage and leadership at national and local levels, but also the right support at the right time from the international community. âWe need to take risks for peace and enable stakeholders with the resources and space to seize opportunities. We have a responsibility to bring down the institutional silos and bring together, in an agile and responsive manner, the full range of the UN system capacities,â he said. The UN chief pointed out that as the medium-term effects of the COVID19 pandemic become more apparent, it is more important than ever to ensure the fund is adequately and predictably resourced. In 2020, the Peacebuilding Fund mobilised over $180 million, which Guterres said is an important sign of the trust the fund has garnered over the years and its demonstrated ability to deliver in the most difficult contexts. "But its resources are now depleted. We must urgently replenish it. Doing so will save lives and serve as a clear demonstration of multilateral support.â Tirumurti highlighted India's constructive and significant role in the context of peacebuilding through its extensive development partnership in developing countries, particularly in Africa and Asia. India continues to assist countries bilaterally in post-conflict situations by providing substantial grants and soft loans, apart from focusing on infrastructure, especially housing, education and health, on connectivity, providing livelihood to those impacted by conflict, especially in agriculture and on projects at the grassroots level. He cited the example from Afghanistan, where India has undertaken projects in every province of the country. India has tried to enhance the security environment of these countries since peace, security and development have to go together. India is also fulfilling its commitment to make available its Covid-19 vaccines to other countries and has already supplied more than six million doses to nine countries in phase one as grant assistance. The Peacebuilding Fund is the UN's financial instrument of first resort to sustain peace in countries or situations at risk or affected by violent conflict. The Fund's 2020-2024 strategy is its most ambitious yet, responding to the Secretary-General's call for a quantum leap of support for peacebuilding and prevention. The Fund has invested over $1.2 billion to date in over 60 countries, with support from almost 60 member states. At the close of the conference, the co-chairs issued a Joint Communique stating that the General Assembly would convene a High-Level meeting on financing peace during its 76th session. "The Conference took place at a time of unprecedented challenges and as the world contends with the tragic immediate effects of the pandemic and its alarming medium to long-term impacts. The unprecedented economic shocks and inadequate response strategies are entrenching social and economic inequalities and increasing risks for crisis, eroding peace and development gains along the way," the Joint Communique said. Member states reiterated the importance of investing in peace. Including funds received for 2020, a total of 39 member states have contributed or pledged over $439 million for peacebuilding in support of the Fund's 2020-2024 Strategy which set a target of $1.5 billion.

NEW DELHI: Twitter on Wednesday said it suspended more than 300 accounts engaged in spam and platform manipulation as the farmers' tractor rally went violent in the national capital on the 72nd Republic Day.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Cabinet has decided to table a bill in Parliament to amend the Constitution for holding the Senate elections through open vote. The decision was taken during the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, presided over by Prime Minister Imran Khan. âThe government wants the (Senate) polls to be held in a transparent manner and without horse-trading. This is why we want Senate polls to be held through an open ballot,â Information Minister Shibli Faraz told the media after the meeting. He said that in the past, money was used in Senate elections and votes were bought making the House election a mockery. He asked what was the use of an upper house in which people come through purchasing of votes. Faraz also said that people opposing the proposed move are forgetting that their own party had demanded open ballot in the past. âThe government will present a constitutional amendment bill in the parliament so that Senate polls are held through open ballot,â he said. Already the government petitioned to the Supreme Court, seeking direction to hold the upcoming Senate elections through open ballot. The decision is pending. Meanwhile, Dawn newspaper quoted a Cabinet member as saying that Prime Minister Khan tasked his advisor parliamentary affairs Babar Awan to table a bill in the National Assembly for holding Senate elections through open ballot when the adviser was giving a briefing on the status of the government's reference in the Supreme Court. Awan said the government had already laid two bills â Constitution Amendment Bill and Electoral Reforms Bill â in Parliament on the basis of which desired legislation could be done for an open ballot. The Cabinet member said Awan had called a meeting of his ministry and its legislation branch to devise a roadmap on how to proceed with the matter in Parliament. It has been proposed that since Senate polls could not be held through show of hand because every voter has to show his preference in the ballot paper. Therefore, to ensure open identity of the voter, the voter should be required to mention his name on the back side of the ballot paper, according to Dawn newspaper. Senate elections will be held in the first half of next month and prime minister Khan's ruling Pakistan Tehreek-I-Insaf is wary that its own members may vote a gay party policy, according to Opposition parties that are against the move.

TOKYO: Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga apologised on Wednesday after lawmakers from his ruling coalition visited night clubs despite his government's call for people to avoid unnecessary outings to curb the spread of Covid-19. The news is another headache for Suga whose approval rating has tumbled due to dissatisfaction with his handling of the pandemic, which critics have called too slow and inconsistent. "I'm terribly sorry that this happened when we are asking people not to eat out after 8pm and to avoid non-essential, non-urgent outings," Suga told parliament. "Each lawmaker should behave to gain the public's understanding." Japan this month issued a state of emergency in Tokyo and other areas to tame a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases. The measure includes a request for restaurants and bars to close by 8pm although there are currently no penalties for non-compliance. "My behaviour was careless at a time when we are asking people to be patient," Jun Matsumoto, a senior lawmaker from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, told reporters. Matsumoto was speaking following a Daily Shincho magazine report that he had visited two night clubs in Tokyo's posh Ginza district after dining at an Italian restaurant last Monday. Kiyohiko Toyama, a lawmaker from the coalition's junior partner Komeito, also apologised after tabloid Shukan Bunshun reported he had visited a high-end night club in Ginza until late last Friday. Twitter users voiced their frustration. "It is just a matter of time before public anger explodes. I don't want a blanket cash-payout of 100,000 yen ($965), I want them to quit! " wrote one user. "They are really stupid. Don't they think about what they are doing and how the public sees them? If they don't, they are unqualified to represent the public," said another.

NEW YORK: A US bankruptcy judge has approved a $17 million payout to dozens of women who accused jailed movie producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual abuse. Weinstein, 68, was sentenced to 23 years in prison last year after being convicted of rape and sexual assault. Delaware Judge Mary Walrath on Monday agreed to the Weinstein Company's liquidation plan, which sets aside the payment. She overruled the objections of several of Weinstein's victims who complained that the settlement prevented them from pursuing other legal claims. The money will be split between 37 women, meaning they are each likely to receive six-figure sums. Lawyers representing some victims had earlier denounced the proposed settlement as insufficient. Eight accusers who rejected the settlement will be able to sue the ex-Hollywood mogul later. Weinstein was found guilty in February 2020 of a criminal sexual act in the first degree and rape in the third degree in a landmark verdict for the #MeToo movement. His sentence capped a remarkable downfall for the "Pulp Fiction" producer who was accused of years of vile predatory behavior by almost 90 women, including Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek. The Weinstein Company declared bankruptcy in March 2018 after the avalanche of claims. Lantern Capital, later renamed Spyglass Media Group, bought its assets for $289 million. Weinstein is also awaiting trial in Los Angeles on rape and sexual assault charges involving five women.

NEW DELHI: China's ByteDance is cutting the size of its 2,000-plus India team and is unsure when it will make a comeback, the company told employees in an internal memo on Wednesday, months after its popular TikTok video app was banned. The move came after India this month decided to retain its ban on TikTok and 58 other Chinese apps following responses from the companies on issues such as compliance and privacy. TikTok, WeChat, Baidu and UC Browser among 59 Chinese apps permanently banned in IndiaThe ban dates from last year when political tension between the neighbours rose over their disputed border. "We initially hoped that this situation would be short-lived ... we find that has not been the case," ByteDance wrote in the memo which was seen by Reuters. "We simply cannot responsibly stay fully staffed while our apps remain un-operational ... we don't know when we will make a comeback in India" In a statement, the company said it was disappointing that despite its efforts it had not received a clear direction on how and when its apps could be reinstated. It did not specify how many employees would lose their jobs. Before the ban, India had been one of TikTok's largest markets and ByteDance in 2019 had laid out plans to invest $1 billion in India. At the time of last year's ban, the Indian government described the apps as prejudicial to the "sovereignty and integrity of India". The move followed a skirmish with Chinese troops. In the United States, the previous Trump administration ordered ByteDance to divest TikTok citing national security concerns, and sought to impose restrictions that would have effectively barred its use. TikTok has also come under scrutiny in Australia for any risks it may pose to users from around potential foreign interference and data privacy issues.

SAN FRANCISCO: A spat erupted Tuesday between Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk as the tech titans' space firms exchanged barbs over their rival satellite internet projects being evaluated by regulators. Amazon, founded and led by Bezos, put out a statement claiming Musk's rival SpaceX project Starlink was seeking design changes that could "create a more dangerous environment for collisions in space" and also increase radio interference. "Despite what SpaceX posts on Twitter, it is SpaceX's proposed changes that would hamstring competition among satellite systems," Amazon said in a statement, outlining its objections to regulators. "It is clearly in SpaceX's interest to smother competition in the cradle if they can, but it is certainly not in the public's interest." Musk meanwhile fired off his own objection to Amazon's complaint, claiming that his plan is moving faster than his rival's. "It does not serve the public to hamstring Starlink today for an Amazon satellite system that is at best several years away from operation," Musk tweeted. @thesheetztweetz It does not serve the public to hamstring Starlink today for an Amazon satellite system that is atâ¦ https://t.co/sNiGKxdXFP— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) 1611658035000Musk, who is also the founder of Tesla and recently overtook Bezos as the world's richest person, is in a race against Amazon's $10 billion Project Kuiper space-based internet delivery system, which has won US regulatory approval to deploy more than 3,000 low-orbit satellites. SpaceX has been deploying small satellites to form a global broadband system and is lobbying regulators for permission to move them into lower orbits, which has prompted Amazon's concerns. SpaceX argued in a letter to the Federal Communications Commission that the orbit modifications being sought would not increase chances of interfering with rival satellites. It contended that any claims of such interference were "misleading," and that Amazon was trying to "stifle competition." SpaceX on Sunday launched its Falcon 9 rocket carrying a record number of satellites on board. Scientists have expressed concerns about the number of objects clogging the space around Earth. SpaceX say their satellites are designed to burn up in the atmosphere within a few years. Project Kuiper aims to deliver satellite-based broadband services in the United States, and eventually around the world, and may offer connectivity for wireless carriers and 5G networks.

NEW DELHI: With International Monetary Fund (IMF) projecting that India will reclaim the status of world's fastest-growing economy and projected its growth at 11.5 per cent in 2021, experts on Wednesday said that India is rebounding to achieve the target of a $5 trillion economy. Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal termed the IMF projections for India as "Bright star in the global economy." "Bright Star in Global Economy: India to continue its growth story at rapid pace under PM @NarendraModi ji, with @IMFNews projecting an impressive 11.5% growth rate for India in 2021. It makes India only major economy to register double-digit growth in 2021," Goyal tweeted. Charan Singh, CEO, EGROW Foundation and former RBI chair professor said, "As was expected, and I had been arguing that India's fundamentals are strong, IMF, in its latest release has projected India's growth at 11.5 per cent in 2021 and 6.8 per cent in 2022. This is the highest growth rate to be recorded by any country." Singh said that IMF observed that the substantial revision in India's growth projection is because of stronger than expected recovery after lockdown. "Hence, India has saved the lives of people in lockdown, and now galloping to recoup growth trajectory. This has been due to the well-calibrated, adequately sequenced policies of the Government. Thus, a V-shaped recovery is on the way, and India is rebounding, to achieve a $5 Trillion Economy, despite the Covid set-back," he added. DK Mishra, a market expert, said that Covid-19 pandemic has impacted worldwide economies in a big way but Indian economy has come out of initial hits due to measures taken by government and strong consumer demands. "The same is evident from strong GST collections and good agricultural growth. The projection for 11.50 per cent growth by IMF in GDP is yet another confirmation of the strong recovery of the economy. The future outlook with the Covid vaccine in the market will be good for our economy," he said. In its latest World Economic Outlook update released on Tuesday, the IMF predicted that India's gross domestic product (GDP) will grow at the pace of 11.5 per cent in 2021. IMF projections show that India's economy will grow much better than China which is predicted to grow at 8.1 per cent, followed by Spain (5.9 per cent), France (5.5 per cent) and United States (5.1 per cent).

WASHINGTON: An Indian national has pleaded guilty to conspiracy and identity theft in connection with an overseas robocall scam that defrauded thousands in the US, mostly elderly people, of nearly $8 million, the Department of Justice said. Shehzadkhan Pathan, 39, operated a call centre in Gujarat's Ahmedabad that placed automated robocalls to victims in the United States, as per court documents. After establishing contact with the victims through these automated calls, Pathan and other "closers" at his call centre would coerce, cajole, and trick victims to send bulk cash through physical shipments and electronic money transfers, federal prosecutors alleged. Pathan and his conspirators used a variety of schemes to convince victims to send money, including impersonating law enforcement officers from the FBI and DEA and representatives of other government agencies such as the Social Security Administration, to threaten victims with severe legal and financial consequences. Conspirators also convinced the victims to send money as initial installments for falsely promised loans, the court documents said. According to the court papers, Pathan also recruited and supervised several money mules, who he directed to receive money sent by the victims. His network of money mules was located in multiple states, including but not limited to Virginia, New Jersey, Minnesota, Texas, California, South Carolina, and Illinois. Pathan assigned various aliases to these individuals and supplied them with hundreds of counterfeit identification documents to facilitate their receipt of cash shipments and money transfers. He then directed the money mules to send the money to himself and other conspirators through various means, including cash deposits into numerous bank accounts and via informal money transmitters known as hawalas, the prosecutors alleged. The Department of Justice said Pathan's scams disproportionately targeted elderly victims, many of whom suffered substantial financial hardship. In total, Pathan is responsible for defrauding over 5,000 US victims of at least $8 million, it added. His sentencing is scheduled for May 14. Pathan faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for the conspiracy, along with a mandatory consecutive term of two years for aggravated identity theft.

WASHINGTON: Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna on Saturday hoped for a peaceful and fair solution to the farmers' issues in India, saying he is encouraged by the ongoing dialogue between the protesting farmers and the government. Khanna, 44, was recently elected for a third consecutive term from the congressional district representing Silicon Valley. âIndia and the US share a rich tradition of democracy and peaceful protests. Farmworkers are the backbone of both our nations and must have their voices heard. I hope there's a peaceful and fair solution so they can provide for their families,â Khanna said in a tweet on Saturday. âI am encouraged by the ongoing dialogue,â he said, joining other American lawmakers who have expressed their views on the ongoing farmers' protest in India, several of whom have expressed their concerns. âAs Co-Chair of the American Sikh Caucus in Congress, my office has received first-hand accounts of the horrific crackdowns on protestors who are trying to peacefully express their disapproval of India's recent agricultural reform legislation,â said Congressman John Garamendi, who along with two other lawmakers wrote a letter to India's Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu early this week. According to the letter, âhundreds of thousands of farmers from the states of Punjab and Haryana that have made their way to New Delhi to peacefully protest these new agricultural laws, and the Indian government has met these peaceful protestors with tear gas, water cannons, barricades, baton attacks, and more. âMany of these farmers have children, relatives, and friends who are US citizens, many of whom have reached out to us to share their concerns about these developments. We urge the Indian government to demonstrate its respect for these crucial democratic freedoms, and to be a model of democratic values in the vital Indo-Pacific regionâ. The letter, dated December 4, was released this week. The two other lawmakers who have expressed their concern on the protest were congressman Jim Costa and congresswoman Shelia Jackson Lee, members of the American Sikh Caucus. Thousands of farmers are currently staying put at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. There have been multiple rounds of talks between representatives of the protestors and the government but the logjam continues.

So I also ran between base with my bat as well. So eventually, I realised baseball was a bit difficult. I can adjust on many things, but I'm going to stick to cricket," he said.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk had once famously said that it didnât matter to him if people had college degrees or even went to high school. Musk had said that he looks for âexceptional abilityâ or the evidence of it rather than degrees. As per a report by CNBC, Musk asks one question in every interview to find out if a person is telling the truth or not. The question he asks is, âTell me about some of the most difficult problems you worked on and how you solved them.â He explained that how asking this question helps. If the âpeople who really solved the problem know exactly how they solved it,â he said. If they know and have solved it then they can âdescribe the little detailsâ and those who havenât will not be able to do so. The premise is simple: if anyone is making something up or telling a lie, then he/she will not be able to back it with conviction. Musk in an interview had said that if people had made a significant accomplishment then âyou want to make sure if there was some significant accomplishment, were they really responsible, or was someone else more responsible?â He further said that, âUsually, someone who really had to struggle with a problem, they really understand the details, and they donât forget.â Interestingly, a study published in the Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition in December 2020 pointed out how Muskâs method can be effective in spotting liars. The study suggested that if the interviewees âprovide longer, more detailed statements about the event of interest, then the investigator will be better able to detect if they are telling the truth or lying.â
